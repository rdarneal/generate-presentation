# Challenger Sale Presentation Template

> **Note:** The `---` dividers in this file are documentation section boundaries. When generating presentation output, use `---` only as slide boundary markers per SKILL.md format rules.

## Framework Overview
**Origin:** Matthew Dixon & Brent Adamson, "The Challenger Sale" (2011). CEB (now Gartner) research across thousands of B2B sales reps found that "Challengers" -- reps who teach, tailor, and take control -- dramatically outperform other profiles in complex sales.
**Best For:** Complex B2B sales pitches, value-based selling, multi-stakeholder deals where the customer's current mental model is part of the problem
**Audience:** Economic buyers, technical evaluators, procurement committees, and cross-functional buying groups
**Duration:** 8-15 slides (20-40 minutes typical)

## Core Philosophy
**Teach. Tailor. Take Control.**

The three pillars:
1. **Teach** -- Deliver a reframe that changes how the customer sees their problem. You are the expert, not the order-taker.
2. **Tailor** -- Speak to the specific context of this customer, this industry, this stakeholder. Generic pitches fail.
3. **Take Control** -- Guide the conversation toward a decision. Do not let consensus-seeking or price anxiety derail the commercial outcome.

**Critical Rule:** Your product does not appear until more than halfway through the deck. The first half is about the customer's world and the insight you bring.

## Emotional Arc

**Trajectory:** Neutral (warm-up) -> Positive (reframe "aha") -> Negative (rational drowning + emotional impact) -> Positive (solution + proof)

**Key transition:** The dip through rational drowning and emotional impact must be deep enough to create urgency but not so deep the audience becomes defensive.

## Slide Structure Template

### 1. TITLE SLIDE
**Elements:**
- Meeting topic / engagement context
- Customer company name prominently featured (this is about them, not you)
- Date, presenter(s), confidentiality marking

**Title Pattern:**
*"Rethinking Procurement Efficiency: What Hidden Costs Are Undermining Your Sourcing Strategy?"*

---

### WARM-UP (1-2 slides)
**Purpose:** Demonstrate deep understanding of the customer's world. Build credibility by showing you have done your homework.

**Content Requirements:**
- Industry trends and pressures the customer faces
- Acknowledged challenges or priorities (sourced from discovery calls, public filings, industry reports)
- Specific reference to the customer's situation (not generic industry slides)
- A tone of "we understand your world" -- not "let us tell you about us"
- No product mentions in this section

**Title Patterns:**
*"Your procurement team manages 40% more supplier relationships than three years ago"*
*"Manufacturing companies face margin pressure from three converging forces"*

---

### REFRAME (1-2 slides)
**Purpose:** Introduce a new insight that challenges the customer's current thinking. Shift their frame of reference so they see a problem or opportunity they had not previously recognized.

**Content Requirements:**
- A clear "reframe" statement -- the new insight
- Data or evidence that supports the reframe (research, benchmarks, case patterns)
- Contrast between "conventional wisdom" and "new reality"
- No product mentions -- the reframe is about their problem, not your solution

**Title Patterns:**
*"The biggest sourcing risk isn't supplier failure -- it's invisible process waste"*
*"Companies optimizing for cost-per-unit are missing a 3x larger efficiency opportunity"*

---

### RATIONAL DROWNING (1-2 slides)
**Purpose:** Quantify the hidden costs, risks, or missed opportunities revealed by the reframe. Make the problem feel large, concrete, and measurable.

**Content Requirements:**
- Hard data: dollar amounts, percentages, time costs, risk exposure
- Calculations the customer can follow and verify
- Use the customer's own scale (their revenue, headcount, transaction volume) where possible
- Cumulative impact: show how small inefficiencies compound

**Title Patterns:**
*"Hidden process waste costs mid-market manufacturers $2.4M annually on average"*
*"Each month of delay increases your competitive exposure by 12%"*

---

### EMOTIONAL IMPACT (1 slide)
**Purpose:** Shift from rational to personal. Connect the problem to individual stakeholders -- their reputation, their team, their career risk.

**Content Requirements:**
- Personal or organizational consequences of inaction
- Stakeholder-specific impact (what this means for the VP of Ops, the CFO, the front-line team)
- Urgency language: time pressure, competitive threat, reputational risk

**Title Patterns:**
*"Without change, your operations team absorbs the growing burden -- and your best people leave first"*
*"Your competitors are already moving -- delay means playing catch-up from a weaker position"*

---

### VALUE PROPOSITION / NEW WAY (1-2 slides)
**Purpose:** Introduce the conceptual "new way" of operating. This is NOT your product yet -- the customer should agree this approach makes sense before they hear your product name.

**Content Requirements:**
- Description of the new approach, framework, or methodology
- How it addresses the root causes identified in the reframe
- Characteristics of what a good solution looks like (criteria that happen to favor you)
- Frame evaluation criteria the customer should demand of any solution

**Title Patterns:**
*"Leading organizations are shifting from reactive sourcing to predictive procurement"*
*"Three capabilities define the next generation of procurement excellence"*

---

### YOUR SOLUTION (2-3 slides)
**Purpose:** Now -- and only now -- map your specific offering to the new approach. Every feature should connect back to the reframe and the value proposition.

**Content Requirements:**
- Product/service overview mapped to the "new way" criteria
- Feature-Advantage-Benefit structure for key capabilities
- Differentiation: what makes your approach unique (without naming competitors)
- Tailored to this customer's specific context
- Focus on the 3-5 capabilities that matter most for this buyer

**Title Patterns:**
*"Our platform delivers unified supplier visibility across all three capability dimensions"*
*"Automated risk scoring eliminates the manual processes that drive hidden costs"*

---

### PROOF / NEXT STEPS (1-2 slides)
**Purpose:** Validate your claims with evidence from similar customers, then close with a specific ask.

**Content Requirements:**
- Customer success story (ideally similar industry, scale, or problem)
- Quantified results: before/after metrics in the same terms used during Rational Drowning
- Social proof: logos, quotes, analyst recognition
- Concrete next steps with timeline and ownership

**Title Patterns:**
*"Acme Manufacturing reduced procurement waste by 34% in the first year"*
*"Recommended next steps: three actions to begin your transformation"*

## Final Pro Tips

1. **Write the reframe first.** If your reframe is weak, the entire deck collapses. Test it: would the customer say "I hadn't thought of it that way"?

2. **Use the customer's own numbers.** A calculation built on their public financials, headcount, or transaction volume is 10x more persuasive than an industry average.

3. **Resist the urge to pitch early.** The first half of the deck is about their world and your insight. Your product is the payoff, not the premise.

4. **Tailor the emotional impact to the room.** CFO: financial exposure and board accountability. VP of Operations: team burnout and competitive disadvantage. Know your audience.

5. **Make the value proposition product-agnostic.** The customer should agree with your "new way" even if they choose a competitor. This builds trust and positions you as a thought leader.

6. **Close with a specific, time-bound ask.** "Schedule a technical deep-dive next week" is a Challenger close. "Let us know if you'd like to learn more" is not.

7. **Prepare for the reframe pushback.** If your reframe is strong, some will resist. Prepare 2-3 additional data points in your appendix for "I don't buy that" reactions.
