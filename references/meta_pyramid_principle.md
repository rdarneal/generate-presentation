# Pyramid Principle Presentation Template

> **Note:** The `---` dividers in this file are documentation section boundaries. When generating presentation output, use `---` only as slide boundary markers per SKILL.md format rules.

## Framework Overview
**Inspired by:** Answer-first executive communication principles widely practiced in management consulting
**Best For:** Executive briefings, strategy recommendations, board communications  
**Audience:** C-suite, board members, senior decision-makers  
**Duration:** 5-15 slides (10-30 minutes typical)

## Core Philosophy
Lead with the answer. Support with grouped logic. Back with evidence. Executives decide in the first 60 seconds — everything after the recommendation either confirms or undermines that initial reaction.

---

## Audience Journey

**Trajectory:** Alignment (answer) -> Confidence (argument 1) -> Deepening confidence (arguments 2-3) -> Conviction (cumulative evidence) -> Commitment (next steps)

**Key transition:** The Executive Summary must land with enough clarity and credibility that the audience spends the rest of the deck confirming their initial agreement, not questioning it. If the answer feels premature, evidence slides become uphill battles.

---

## Slide Structure Template

### 1. TITLE SLIDE
**Elements:**
- Project/Topic name
- "Answer" tagline (optional preview)
- Date, presenter, confidentiality marking

**Example Title:**
*"Growth Strategy Recommendation: Prioritize Enterprise Segment"*

---

### 2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / ANSWER FIRST
**Purpose:** State your main recommendation immediately. This slide is the single most important slide in the deck — a busy executive who reads only this slide should understand the recommendation and its rationale.

**Content Requirements:**
- 1-2 sentence bottom-line answer
- 2-4 key supporting reasons (your main arguments, previewed as bullets)
- Expected impact/outcome (quantified if possible)

**Title Patterns:**
*"We recommend pivoting to enterprise customers to achieve 40% revenue growth"*
*"Acquiring Company X is the fastest path to closing the AI capability gap"*

**Slide Pattern:** Pyramid Principle (A)

**Typical Structure:**
```
RECOMMENDATION
[Clear, decisive statement]

KEY REASONS
1. [Supporting argument 1]
2. [Supporting argument 2]
3. [Supporting argument 3]

EXPECTED IMPACT
[Quantified outcome]
```

---

### SITUATION/CONTEXT (Optional -- include when audience needs alignment on current state)
**Purpose:** Establish shared understanding of the starting conditions before presenting arguments.

**Content Requirements:**
- Market context or industry dynamics
- Current performance baseline (quantified)
- Key constraints, assumptions, or givens

**Title Patterns:**
*"Current customer acquisition costs have risen 60% YoY"*
*"Three market shifts are reshaping our competitive landscape"*

**Slide Pattern:** SCQA Micro-Narrative (E) or What-So What-Now What (B)

---

### MAIN BODY: ARGUMENT BLOCKS

Each argument gets its own section (1-3 slides per argument)

#### ARGUMENT HEADER SLIDES (1 per argument)
**Purpose:** State the argument as a conclusion. The title alone should convey the claim; the body previews the evidence that follows.

**Content Requirements:**
- Main claim stated as a declarative sentence in the title
- Preview of 2-3 supporting evidence points
- Each argument must be MECE with sibling arguments (no overlap, complete coverage)

**Title Patterns:**
*"Enterprise customers deliver 3x higher LTV than SMB segment"*
*"We have proven enterprise sales capability with top-tier wins"*

**Slide Pattern:** Pyramid Principle (A)

**Typical Structure:**
```
[ARGUMENT AS TITLE — declarative statement of the claim]

SUPPORTING POINTS
1. [Evidence preview 1 — what the next slides will prove]
2. [Evidence preview 2]
3. [Evidence preview 3] (optional)
```

#### EVIDENCE SLIDES (1-2 per argument)
**Purpose:** Prove each argument with data, analysis, or case examples.

**Content Requirements:**
- Title states the specific finding or data point (not a topic label)
- Charts/graphs with clear takeaway, or data tables with highlighted insights
- Case examples with quantified outcomes
- Comparative analysis where applicable

**Title Patterns:**
*"Enterprise retention rate is 94% vs 67% for SMB"*
*"Top 10 enterprise wins generated $47M in first-year revenue"*

**Slide Pattern:** What-So What-Now What (B) or STAR Micro-Case (I) for case-based evidence

**Typical Structure (data-driven):**
```
[FINDING AS TITLE — specific data point or insight]

[Chart or data visualization with clear takeaway]

KEY INSIGHT
[1-2 sentence interpretation — what this data means for the argument]
```

**Typical Structure (case-based):**
```
[OUTCOME AS TITLE — specific result achieved]

CONTEXT: [Who, what situation — 1-2 lines]
ACTION: [What was done — 2-3 bullets]
RESULT: [Quantified outcome — bold, prominent]
```

**Visual Priority:** Chart > bullets. If using text, max 5 bullets.

---

### CLOSING SECTION (2-3 slides)

#### STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS (1 slide)
**Purpose:** State the consequences of the recommendation. What changes, what is required, and what risks must be managed.

**Content Requirements:**
- Secondary consequences of the recommendation
- Required capabilities or organizational changes
- Key risks and mitigation approach

**Title Patterns:**
*"This shift requires 3 key organizational changes"*
*"Successful execution depends on resolving two capability gaps"*

**Slide Pattern:** Pyramid Principle (A) or Monroe's Visualization (G)

#### IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP (1 slide)
**Purpose:** Show the path from decision to execution.

**Content Requirements:**
- Phased timeline with key milestones
- Resource requirements and dependencies
- Quick wins that build momentum early
- Clear success metrics for each phase

**Title Patterns:**
*"Recommended 18-month transition plan with Phase 1 in 90 days"*
*"Three-phase rollout delivers first results by Q3"*

**Slide Pattern:** Problem-Solution-Benefit (J)

#### NEXT STEPS & DECISION REQUEST (1 slide)
**Purpose:** Close with a specific, concrete ask. The audience should leave knowing exactly what they are being asked to decide and by when.

**Content Requirements:**
- Specific decision or approval being requested
- Decision timeline and urgency
- Immediate follow-up actions
- Who is responsible for what

**Title Patterns:**
*"Seeking approval to proceed with Phase 1 planning by March 15"*
*"Three decisions needed this quarter to maintain timeline"*

**Slide Pattern:** Pyramid Principle (A)

**Typical Structure:**
```
[DECISION REQUEST AS TITLE — specific ask with timeline]

THE ASK
[What approval, decision, or action is needed]

TIMELINE
[When the decision is needed and why]

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. [Action item — owner — deadline]
2. [Action item — owner — deadline]
3. [Action item — owner — deadline]
```

## Slide Title Guidelines

### DO: Use Action Titles
âœ… "Enterprise segment generates 73% gross margin vs 51% for SMB"  
âœ… "Our top 10 enterprise wins validate sales model effectiveness"  
âœ… "Three organizational changes required for successful transition"

### DON'T: Use Topic Titles
âŒ "Customer Segments"  
âŒ "Financial Analysis"  
âŒ "Implementation Considerations"

**Rule:** Every title should be a complete sentence stating your conclusion.

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing:

**Logic Flow:**
- [ ] Answer is stated clearly in the opening recommendation slide
- [ ] Each argument directly supports the answer
- [ ] Evidence clearly supports each argument
- [ ] No logical gaps or leaps

**Clarity:**
- [ ] Every slide title is self-contained conclusion
- [ ] Non-expert could follow main argument from titles alone
- [ ] Data visualizations are immediately clear
- [ ] Jargon is defined or avoided

**MECE:**
- [ ] Main arguments don't overlap
- [ ] Main arguments cover complete reasoning
- [ ] Sub-points within arguments follow logical grouping
- Common MECE patterns: Time-based (past/present/future), Stakeholder-based (customers/employees/investors), Value chain (supply/operations/distribution), P&L line items (revenue/cost/margin), Strategic levers (market/product/operations)

**Executive Ready:**
- [ ] Can stand alone without verbal presentation
- [ ] Answer is evident in first 60 seconds
- [ ] Supporting detail is accessible but not required
- [ ] Next steps are concrete and clear

---

## Common Patterns by Recommendation Type

### Strategic Pivot
1. Answer: Shift from X to Y
2. Argument 1: Y is more attractive (market/economics)
3. Argument 2: We can win in Y (capability)
4. Argument 3: Timing is right (urgency/opportunity)

### Investment Decision
1. Answer: Invest/Don't invest in X
2. Argument 1: Market opportunity sizing
3. Argument 2: Competitive positioning/advantage
4. Argument 3: Financial return/risk profile

### Operational Improvement
1. Answer: Implement solution X
2. Argument 1: Problem quantification (cost of status quo)
3. Argument 2: Solution efficacy (proven results)
4. Argument 3: Implementation feasibility (resources/timeline)

## Multi-Thread Adaptation

When the input contains multiple parallel threads that each require a recommendation (e.g., 4 strategic initiatives each needing investment approval), adapt the Pyramid structure to maintain thread coherence. See SKILL.md "Multi-Thread Management" for strategy definitions.

**Thread-per-Pillar Pyramid (2-5 threads):**

| Section | Single-Thread (standard) | Multi-Thread Adaptation |
|---|---|---|
| **Executive Summary** | One recommendation | Prioritized list of all thread recommendations with overall investment/impact summary |
| **Context** | Shared background | Shared context + enumerate all threads |
| **Argument Blocks** | 2-3 MECE arguments supporting one recommendation | Each argument block = one thread. Within each block, the argument header states that thread's recommendation, and evidence slides support it |
| **Closing** | Consolidated next steps | Implementation roadmap across all threads, phased by priority |

**MECE Application to Threads:** The threads themselves should be MECE — mutually exclusive (each covers a distinct area) and collectively exhaustive (together they cover the full scope of the input). If threads overlap, consolidate them before building the deck.

**Slide Budget Management:** With multiple threads, slide count pressure increases. Limit each thread's argument block to 1 header + 1 evidence slide. If more depth is needed, use appendix slides per thread.

**Example — 4 Strategic Initiatives Requiring Approval:**

- **Executive Summary (1 slide):** "We recommend approving all four initiatives in a phased sequence — total investment of $12M over 18 months with projected $45M return"
  - Ranked list: Initiative B (highest ROI, fastest), Initiative D, Initiative A, Initiative C
- **Context (1 slide):** "Annual planning identified four capability gaps; each initiative addresses a distinct gap"
- **Argument Block — Initiative B (2 slides):**
  - Header: "Initiative B closes the automation gap and delivers $18M in annual savings"
  - Evidence: current manual cost, automation benchmark, implementation feasibility
- **Argument Block — Initiative D (2 slides):**
  - Header: "Initiative D modernizes the data platform, enabling Initiatives A and C"
  - Evidence: dependency analysis, platform comparison, migration timeline
- **Argument Block — Initiative A (2 slides):**
  - Header: "Initiative A expands enterprise coverage into the fastest-growing segment"
  - Evidence: market sizing, competitive window, revenue projection
- **Argument Block — Initiative C (1 slide, compressed):**
  - Header: "Initiative C addresses compliance risk at minimal incremental cost"
  - Evidence: regulatory timeline, cost of non-compliance, implementation scope
- **Closing (2 slides):** Phased roadmap (B first, then D, then A+C in parallel) + decision request

**Slide Count:** 12 slides

**Multi-Thread Quality Check:**
- [ ] Executive Summary accounts for ALL threads with clear prioritization
- [ ] Each thread's argument block is self-contained — a reader could understand one thread's case without reading the others
- [ ] Threads are MECE: no overlap in scope, collectively covering the full input
- [ ] Dependencies between threads are explicitly stated (e.g., "Initiative D enables A and C")

## Adaptation Notes

**Standard Decks (8-12 slides):**
- 2-3 main arguments with 1-2 evidence slides each
- Compress context to 1 slide or omit if audience is aligned
- Combine implications and next steps into 1 closing slide

**Compact Decks (3-7 slides):**
- 1-2 main arguments with 1 evidence slide each
- Omit context section entirely
- Single closing slide

**Extended Decks (13-15 slides):**
- 3 main arguments with 2 evidence slides each
- Include full context section
- Separate implications, roadmap, and next steps into individual slides
- Maximum 15 slides; move additional analysis to appendix

**No minimum:** For clear, simple recommendations, 1-3 slides is perfectly fine.

**For Board Presentations:**
- Lead with financial impact
- Include risk mitigation explicitly
- Add governance/approval framework
- Provide decision criteria

**For Internal Strategy:**
- More detail on implementation
- Address organizational change
- Include stakeholder map
- Define success metrics

## Template Usage Example

**Topic:** "Should we build or buy AI capability?"

**Pyramid Structure:**
- **Answer:** Buy AI capability through acquisition of Company X
  - **Argument 1:** Build timeline (18+ months) creates unacceptable competitive risk
    - Evidence: Competitor capabilities advancing at X rate
    - Evidence: Our current AI talent pipeline requires Y months to ramp
    - Evidence: Customer contract renewals at risk without AI features
  - **Argument 2:** Company X offers proven technology at attractive valuation
    - Evidence: Their product benchmarks show Z performance
    - Evidence: $XM purchase price = A months of build cost
    - Evidence: Customer overlap enables immediate cross-sell
  - **Argument 3:** Post-merger integration risks are manageable
    - Evidence: Cultural alignment assessment shows B fit
    - Evidence: Technical stack compatible with C migration path
    - Evidence: Key talent retention plan addresses D risk

**Slide Count:** 12 slides
- Executive Summary: 1
- Context: 1
- Argument 1: 1 header + 2 evidence = 3
- Argument 2: 1 header + 1 evidence = 2
- Argument 3: 1 header + 1 evidence = 2
- Implementation + Next Steps: 2
- Decision request: 1

**Pattern Mapping:**
| Slide | Title | Pattern |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Title Slide | -- |
| 2 | "We recommend acquiring Company X to close the AI capability gap" | Pyramid Principle (A) |
| 3 | "Building AI in-house creates an 18-month competitive exposure window" | Pyramid Principle (A) |
| 4 | "Competitor capabilities are advancing at 2x our internal ramp rate" | What-So What-Now What (B) |
| 5 | "Our talent pipeline requires 14 months to reach production readiness" | What-So What-Now What (B) |
| 6 | "Company X offers proven technology at 0.6x build cost" | Pyramid Principle (A) |
| 7 | "Their platform benchmarks at 94th percentile on our evaluation criteria" | What-So What-Now What (B) |
| 8 | "Post-merger integration risks are manageable with a phased approach" | Pyramid Principle (A) |
| 9 | "Cultural alignment assessment shows 85% compatibility on key dimensions" | STAR Micro-Case (I) |
| 10 | "This acquisition requires three organizational changes" | Pyramid Principle (A) |
| 11 | "Recommended 12-month integration timeline with Phase 1 in 90 days" | Problem-Solution-Benefit (J) |
| 12 | "Seeking board approval to proceed with due diligence by March 15" | Pyramid Principle (A) |

## Final Pro Tips

1. **Write titles last.** Draft all content first, then distill each slide to its action title. The title should be the last thing written and the first thing the audience reads.
2. **Test with titles only.** Print the deck showing only titles. If the logic flow is clear and persuasive from titles alone, the deck works. If not, rewrite titles until it does.
3. **One message per slide.** If you find yourself writing "and also" or "additionally," that is a signal to create a new slide. Each slide earns its place by making one claim.
4. **Quantify everything.** Replace every instance of "significant," "substantial," or "improved" with a specific number. Executives trust precision.
5. **Front-load bad news.** Address risks, concerns, and counterarguments directly in the argument structure. Burying them in the appendix signals you are hiding something.
6. **Anticipate "why."** Each slide should answer the "why" that the previous slide provoked. If Slide 5 does not logically follow from Slide 4, there is a structural gap.
7. **Kill your darlings.** Interesting but non-essential analysis belongs in the appendix. Every slide in the main deck must directly support the recommendation.
