# Slide Pattern I: STAR Micro-Case Slide Pattern

> **Note:** The `---` dividers in this file are documentation section boundaries. When generating presentation output, use `---` only as slide boundary markers per SKILL.md format rules.

## Pattern Overview

**Designation:** Pattern I (Layer 2 -- Slide-Level Pattern)
**Concept:** A complete case study -- Situation, Task, Action, Result -- compressed onto a single slide. Distills an entire project narrative to its essence for use as a proof point, portfolio item, or social proof element.
**Origin:** Behavioral interviewing methodology (STAR format), adapted to slide-level design. While the STAR meta-flow (Layer 1) spans 7-13 slides, this micro-case fits a full success story into one slide.
**Best For:** Proof points in sales/marketing decks, portfolio slides, social proof, RFP responses, internal retrospective snapshots.

**When to Use:**
- You need a complete case on a single slide as supporting evidence
- The audience needs to see you have done this before, but the case is not the main event
- You are building a portfolio or gallery view showing breadth of experience
- A proof point requires all four STAR elements to be credible

**When NOT to Use:**
- The case deserves 5+ slides of depth -- use the STAR meta-flow instead
- The audience needs to understand your methodology in detail
- The results are nuanced or mixed and cannot be reduced to a clear outcome
- You have no quantified result -- a micro-case without numbers is just an anecdote

---

## Core Philosophy

**Prove it in a single slide.**

The STAR Micro-Case is your credibility tool. It shows you have done this before, with specific actions and quantified results. The compression forces three disciplines:

1. **Ruthless prioritization.** Choose the one Situation aspect that matters, the one Task line, the 2-3 most distinctive Actions, and the one Result that proves it worked. This forces you to know what actually made the difference.
2. **Audience-first thinking.** A micro-case answers the audience's unspoken question: "Have you done something like this before?" Every element must maximize relevance to the person reading the slide.
3. **Impact clarity.** "Significantly improved performance" does not fit this pattern. "Reduced processing time by 86%, from 14 days to 48 hours" does. The constraint of space produces the discipline of specificity.

A single slide with a complete STAR story feels more credible than a testimonial quote or a metric without context. The STAR structure gives the audience enough narrative to believe the result is real.

**The acid test:** Can you tell this story at a dinner party in 30 seconds and have the listener understand what happened and be impressed?

**STAR Micro vs BAB distinction:** STAR Micro emphasizes the process and methodology (what you did). BAB emphasizes the contrast between states (how things changed). Use STAR Micro when your actions are the differentiator. Use BAB when the dramatic before/after gap is the selling point.

## Detailed Element Guide

### SITUATION -- 1-2 lines maximum (15-30 words)

Provides just enough context for the Action to make sense.
- Must include: industry/sector, company size or scale indicator, and core problem
- Use concrete specifics: "$8B regional bank" not "a financial institution"
- If confidential: "Fortune 500 retailer" or "Series C SaaS platform ($40M ARR)"
- Keep tight -- every word beyond minimum context steals space from Action and Result

**Good:** "Regional bank ($8B assets) with manual loan processing averaging 14 days per application."
**Bad:** "A company had some operational challenges." / "Founded in 1987, the client is a leading provider..." (too long)

### TASK -- 1 line (10-20 words)

The specific goal, framed as what needed to happen.
- Include a measurable target: "reduce to under 3 days" not "improve speed"
- Include a constraint or timeframe if impressive: "within 6 months" or "without adding headcount"
- Frame as objective, not activity: "Reduce churn from 8% to under 3%" not "Build a retention program"
- Can be merged with Situation for brevity (S+T merger)

**Good:** "Cut loan processing from 14 days to under 3 days within 9 months, maintaining compliance."
**Bad:** "Improve overall performance." / "Help the client with their digital transformation journey."

### ACTION -- 2-3 bullet points, one line each

Where you differentiate yourself. Shows what YOU did that was distinctive.
- Start each bullet with an active verb: Built, Redesigned, Deployed, Mapped, Piloted
- Be specific: "Built custom ML model for document classification" not "Implemented AI solution"
- Each bullet describes a different action -- not three variations of the same step
- If bullets could describe a competitor's work, you are not specific enough

**Good:** "Mapped 14-step process, eliminated 6 redundant handoffs" / "Built custom ML classifier (replaced 60% of manual review)"
**Bad:** "Implemented best practices" / "Optimized the workflow" / "Leveraged our proprietary methodology"

### RESULT -- 1-2 lines, quantified, visually emphasized

The most important element. Must include numbers.
- Must mirror the Task metric: if Task was "reduce to under 4 hours," Result reports actual time
- Include the before-and-after delta: "14 days to 48 hours" stronger than "48-hour processing"
- Include timeframe to result if impressive
- One secondary metric adds depth: "CSAT +31 points" or "Zero compliance violations"

**Good:** "Loan processing: 14 days to 48 hours (86% reduction). CSAT +31 points. Application volume +22%."
**Bad:** "Results were positive." / "Client was very satisfied."

### TITLE -- States client + key result

**Formulas:**
- `[Client Name]: [Key Result Metric] [in Timeframe]`
- `[Key Result] for [Client/Industry Description]`
- `[Before -> After Delta] [for Whom/What]`

## Title Writing Guide

### DO Examples

1. "Acme Corp: 60% reduction in processing time within 8 weeks"
2. "Regional bank: loan processing from 14 days to 48 hours"
3. "Meridian Health ER wait times cut from 58 to 23 minutes, exceeding target"
4. "Series C SaaS: monthly churn reduced from 8% to 2.4% in 5 months"

### DON'T Examples

1. "Case Study" -- labels the slide type, says nothing
2. "Success Story" -- self-congratulatory and empty
3. "Our Work in Healthcare" -- topic label, no specifics
4. "Relevant Experience" -- a section header, not a slide title

## Compression Guide

### The Elevator Pitch Test

Tell the story aloud in 30 seconds. If you cannot, you have not identified the essence. The 30-second version is your micro-case.

### What to Cut

- Background detail (founding year, org chart, history)
- Process steps beyond 3
- Team composition (unless team size is the impressive part)
- Timeline detail (unless speed is impressive)
- Obstacles and pivots (save for full STAR deck)
- Secondary results that do not add to the headline impact

### S+T Merger Technique

When Situation and Task fit in one line, merge them:

**Separate:** SITUATION: Fortune 500 retailer with 18-hour fulfillment delays. TASK: Reduce to under 4 hours without adding staff.
**Merged:** CONTEXT: Fortune 500 retailer needed to reduce fulfillment from 18 hours to under 4 hours without adding staff.

## Compatibility Matrix

| Meta-Flow | Section | Role | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| **STAR** | Any section (compact) | PRIMARY | Each case as single micro-case slide; ideal for multi-case portfolio decks |
| **AIDA** | Desire (social proof) | PRIMARY | Proof points showing results for similar clients build desire through evidence |
| **Three-Act** | Act 3 Resolution (proof) | PRIMARY | Concrete evidence that the resolution is real and repeatable |
| **Challenger Sale** | Proof section | PRIMARY | After presenting solution, micro-cases prove it works in real world |
| **PAS** | Solution (proof) | PRIMARY | After presenting solution, micro-cases demonstrate it actually works |

## Before/After Examples

### Example 1: Consulting Engagement

**BEFORE:**
```
Title: "Client Project - Healthcare"
We worked with a hospital to improve their emergency department.
Key activities: Conducted interviews, Mapped processes, Identified
improvements, Developed recommendations. The client was satisfied.
```

**AFTER:**
```
Title: "Meridian Health: ER wait times cut from 58 to 23
minutes, exceeding 30-minute target"

SITUATION: 450-bed regional hospital with 58-minute average
ER wait times, double the regional benchmark.

TASK: Reduce wait times below 30 minutes within 6 months.

ACTION:
* Lean workflow redesign eliminated 4 of 11 redundant
  triage handoffs
* Deployed real-time patient tracking dashboard at every
  nurse station
* Staff co-design workshops drove adoption within 4 weeks

RESULT: 58 min -> 23 min (60% reduction). Patient
complaints down 71%. Regional quality award.
```

### Example 2: Product Implementation

**BEFORE:**
```
Title: "Case Study: SaaS Company"
Challenge: Customer retention was an issue
What we did: Analyzed churn data, Built new onboarding flow
Outcome: Retention improved significantly
```

**AFTER:**
```
Title: "Series C SaaS ($40M ARR): monthly churn from 8%
to 2.4% in 5 months"

CONTEXT: $40M ARR SaaS company with 8.1% monthly churn
in SMB segment, needed reduction to under 3% within two
quarters.

ACTION:
* Built predictive churn model from product usage data
  to identify at-risk accounts 21 days in advance
* Automated 14-day onboarding sequence with milestone
  triggers replacing manual CSM outreach
* Restructured SMB pricing to align with actual usage

RESULT: Monthly churn: 8.1% -> 2.4% in 5 months.
Recovered $3.2M in at-risk ARR. NPS: 22 -> 51.
```

## Variations by Audience

| Audience | Title Focus | S+T Approach | Action Emphasis | Result Emphasis |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Executive** | Result metric as headline | Merged into one context line | 1-2 bullets, strategic decisions over execution detail | Large format, hero metric, financial impact |
| **Technical** | Can reference methodology/technology | Brief (technical audiences grasp context quickly) | 3 bullets with tools, architectures, benchmarks | Include technical + business metrics |
| **Sales / Prospect** | Lead with matching industry | Frame to mirror prospect's world | Transferable methodology, not one-off solutions | ROI, cost savings, timeframe to results |
| **Internal Retrospective** | Can be candid about what worked and what did not | Include team size, resource constraints | Include obstacles, pivots, and what did not work | Report honestly; include shortfalls alongside wins |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Situation too long (>2 lines).** Steals space from Action and Result. Fix: limit to 1-2 lines of minimum context.
2. **No quantified Result.** "The client was satisfied" is the most damaging mistake. Fix: every Result must include at least one number.
3. **Vague Actions.** "Implemented best practices" describes anyone's work. Fix: replace every generic verb-noun pair with a specific one.
4. **Result does not mirror Task metric.** Task says "reduce processing time" but Result reports satisfaction scores. Fix: close the metric loop.
5. **Missing the "so what" for this audience.** Healthcare case shown to financial services prospect. Fix: choose cases matching the audience's industry or challenge type.
6. **Too many Action bullets (>3).** Turns micro-case into project plan. Fix: pick the 2-3 most distinctive or impactful actions.
7. **Generic case that could describe anyone's work.** Fix: include at least one specific detail in each element that is unique to your work.

## Pro Tips

1. **Write the Result first, then work backward.** Start with the outcome, then write the Task it fulfills, the Actions that produced it, and the Situation that makes it necessary. Reverse-engineering ensures every element connects to the punchline.
2. **If your Action bullets could describe any competitor's work, you are not specific enough.** "Built an XGBoost classifier on 50K documents achieving 99.4% accuracy" describes only your project.
3. **Put the Result in the title.** The title is the first and sometimes only thing read. Lead with the headline number.
4. **Match your micro-case industry to your audience's industry.** A healthcare case shown to a healthcare prospect is 3x more persuasive than a manufacturing case.
5. **One great micro-case beats three mediocre ones.** If your strongest case is significantly more impressive, give it a full slide and cut the weaker cases.
6. **Close the metric loop every time.** If the Situation says "58-minute wait times" and the Task says "under 30 minutes," the Result must report the actual wait time achieved.
7. **Test readability at presentation distance.** Print the slide, tape it to a wall, step back 6 feet. If you cannot read it, the text is too dense.
