# STAR (Situation-Task-Action-Result) Presentation Template

> **Note:** The `---` dividers in this file are documentation section boundaries. When generating presentation output, use `---` only as slide boundary markers per SKILL.md format rules.

## Framework Overview
**Origin:** Behavioral interviewing methodology, adapted for project narratives and achievement storytelling
**Best For:** Case study presentations, portfolio reviews, project retrospectives, success stories
**Audience:** Clients, prospects, internal stakeholders, hiring committees, RFP evaluators
**Duration:** 5-13 slides per case (10-25 minutes typical); multi-case decks: 10-15 slides (use STAR Micro-Case pattern for compression)

## Core Philosophy
Show what you did, how you did it, and what it achieved. Let the work speak through specifics, not claims. The bulk of every story lives in the ACTION section -- that is where credibility is built or lost.

---

## Emotional Arc

**Trajectory:** Orientation (situation) -> Tension (task/challenge) -> Sustained engagement (action) -> Payoff (result) -> Reflection (implications)

**Key transition:** The shift from Task to Action is where credibility is built or lost. If the Action section reads as vague or generic ("we optimized the process"), the audience disengages. Specificity in Action is what separates a compelling case study from a forgettable one.

## Slide Structure Template

### 1. TITLE SLIDE
**Elements:**
- Case study or project name
- Client/company name (if permissible)
- Industry and engagement type
- Date, presenter, confidentiality marking

**Title Pattern:**
*"Digital Transformation at Meridian Health: Reducing Patient Wait Times by 40%"*

---

### 2. SITUATION (1-2 slides, ~20% of deck)
**Purpose:** Establish the context so the audience understands why the work mattered.

**Content Requirements:**
- Organization background (industry, size, market position)
- Relevant environmental factors (market shifts, competitive pressure, regulatory changes)
- Baseline metrics or performance state (quantified where possible)
- Stakeholder landscape and time frame

**Title Patterns:**
*"Meridian Health faced rising patient complaints and a 58-minute average ER wait time"*
*"A $2B retailer's legacy systems were creating 12-hour order fulfillment delays"*

**Slide Pattern:** SCQA Micro-Narrative (E) or Pyramid Principle (A)

---

### 3. TASK (1 slide, ~10% of deck)
**Purpose:** Define the specific goal, challenge, or mandate.

**Content Requirements:**
- Clear statement of the objective or challenge assigned
- Success criteria or target metrics (quantified)
- Scope boundaries (what was in/out)
- Key constraints (budget, timeline, team size)

**Title Patterns:**
*"Our mandate: cut ER wait times below 30 minutes within 6 months"*
*"Redesign the order pipeline to achieve same-day fulfillment without increasing headcount"*

**Slide Pattern:** Pyramid Principle (A)

**Typical Structure:**
```
OBJECTIVE
[Clear, measurable goal statement]

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Target metric 1
- Target metric 2

CONSTRAINTS
- Budget: $X / Timeline: Y months / Team: Z people
```

---

### 4. ACTION (4-6 slides, ~55% of deck)
**Purpose:** Detail what was specifically done, how decisions were made, and how execution unfolded.

**Content Requirements:**
- Methodology or approach overview (1 slide)
- Key phases or workstreams (1-2 slides)
- Critical decisions and their rationale (1-2 slides)
- Obstacles encountered and how they were overcome (1 slide)
- Interim metrics where available

**Title Patterns:**
*"We redesigned the triage workflow using lean methodology, eliminating 4 redundant handoffs"*
*"A/B testing across 3 fulfillment models revealed hub-and-spoke as the optimal design"*

**Slide Patterns:** Pyramid Principle (A) for action titles throughout; FAB (C) for tools/solutions; MECE Decomposition (D) for workstream structure

**Action Section Structure Options:**

- **Pattern A: Chronological Phases** — Best when the project had clear, sequential phases. Slides: Approach → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Obstacles & Pivots. Each phase title states the key outcome of that phase.
- **Pattern B: Workstream Parallel** — Best when multiple initiatives ran concurrently. Slides: Approach → Workstream 1 → Workstream 2 → Workstream 3 → Integration & Decisions. Include a synthesis slide showing how workstreams converged.
- **Pattern C: Decision-Driven** — Best when the story's value lies in quality of decisions. Slides: Framework → Decision 1 → Decision 2 → Decision 3 → Execution. Each decision slide explains the rationale ("we chose X over Y because...").

---

### 5. RESULT (1-2 slides, ~10% of deck)
**Purpose:** Deliver the payoff. Quantify outcomes and connect back to the original Task.

**Content Requirements:**
- Primary outcome metrics (quantified, with before/after comparison)
- Secondary or unexpected benefits
- Timeline to results
- Stakeholder or client feedback (quote if available)
- Sustainability indicators (did results hold?)

**Title Patterns:**
*"ER wait times dropped from 58 to 23 minutes, exceeding the 30-minute target by 23%"*
*"Same-day fulfillment reached 94% within 4 months, driving a 15% increase in repeat purchases"*

**Slide Pattern:** What-So What-Now What (B) or BAB Mini-Story (F)

**Typical Structure:**
```
PRIMARY OUTCOMES
- Metric 1: [Before] → [After] (X% improvement)
- Metric 2: [Before] → [After] (X% improvement)

ADDITIONAL IMPACT
- Unexpected benefit or ripple effect
- Client/stakeholder quote (optional)

SUSTAINABILITY
[Evidence that results held over time]
```

## Slide Title Guidelines

### DO: Use Action Titles
- "Process mapping identified 23 handoff points — 11 were redundant"
- "ER wait times dropped from 58 to 23 minutes, exceeding target by 23%"
- "Chose custom ML model over off-shelf due to unique compliance requirements"

### DON'T: Use Topic Titles
- "Situation Overview"
- "Our Approach"
- "Results"

**Rule:** Every title should state what happened, what was decided, or what was achieved — not describe the category of content. In a STAR deck, the audience should be able to read the titles alone and follow the entire case narrative.

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing:

**Narrative Flow:**
- [ ] Situation establishes clear baseline conditions with quantified metrics
- [ ] Task defines a specific, measurable goal that follows logically from the Situation
- [ ] Action section is the longest part of the deck (50-60% of slides)
- [ ] Result ties directly back to Task targets using the same metrics from Situation
- [ ] A reader could follow the complete story from slide titles alone

**Specificity:**
- [ ] Actions describe what was *specifically* done, not vague generalities
- [ ] Decision rationale is explained (why this approach, not just what)
- [ ] Obstacles and adaptations are included (adds credibility)
- [ ] Interim results or milestones appear in the Action section

**Quantification:**
- [ ] Situation includes baseline metrics
- [ ] Task includes target metrics
- [ ] Result includes outcome metrics with before/after deltas
- [ ] Financial impact is stated where applicable (revenue, cost, ROI)

**Audience Readiness:**
- [ ] Level of technical detail matches audience sophistication
- [ ] Confidential information is appropriately redacted
- [ ] Deck can stand alone without verbal walkthrough

## Common Patterns by Case Type

### Client Engagement / Consulting Project
1. **Situation:** Client's industry, size, and the business problem they faced
2. **Task:** Scope of engagement, success criteria, constraints
3. **Action:** Discovery and diagnosis, solution design, implementation, change management
4. **Result:** Business outcomes, ROI, client satisfaction, follow-on engagement

*Action Focus:* Methodology rigor, stakeholder management, analytical frameworks used

### Turnaround Story
1. **Situation:** The crisis or decline — what was failing and how bad it had gotten
2. **Task:** Stabilize and reverse the trajectory — specific recovery targets
3. **Action:** Root cause diagnosis, triage actions, structural fixes, cultural shifts
4. **Result:** Recovery metrics, before/after comparison, sustainability evidence

*Action Focus:* Diagnostic process, prioritization under pressure, phased recovery

### Operational Improvement
1. **Situation:** Process inefficiency, quality issues, or cost overruns with baseline metrics
2. **Task:** Improvement targets — efficiency gains, cost reduction, quality standards
3. **Action:** Process mapping, bottleneck analysis, solution design, pilot testing, rollout
4. **Result:** Operational metrics improvement, cost savings, quality gains

*Action Focus:* Analytical methodology (Lean, Six Sigma), data-driven decision-making

## Adaptation Notes

**Shorter Presentations (5-10 slides):**
- Combine Situation and Task into 1 slide
- Compress Action to 2-3 slides (highest-impact actions only)
- Keep Result to 1 slide with top 3 metrics

**Extended Presentations (12-15 slides):**
- Expand Situation to 2 slides (environment + baseline metrics)
- Expand Action to 5-6 slides with deeper strategic detail
- Use 2 Result slides (quantified outcomes + broader impact)
- Maximum 15 slides; move methodology details to appendix

**Multi-Case Decks (portfolio reviews, RFP responses):**
- Compress each case: Situation + Task on 1 slide, Action on 2 slides, Result on 1 slide
- Lead with the strongest or most relevant case
- Add a synthesis slide at the end: cross-case themes and aggregate impact
- Two cases is the sweet spot within 15 slides; for 3+ cases, use STAR Micro-Case pattern

**For Executive Audiences:**
- Compress Situation and Task
- Action should emphasize strategic decisions, not technical execution
- Quantify in business terms (revenue, margin, ROI)

**For Sales / RFP Contexts:**
- Choose cases that mirror the prospect's industry, size, or challenge
- Emphasize transferable methodology in Action
- Add a "Relevance to Your Situation" slide connecting the case to the prospect's needs

**For Internal Retrospectives:**
- Situation and Task can be brief (audience already knows the context)
- Emphasize lessons learned and process improvements in Action
- Result should include both successes and areas for improvement
- End with forward-looking recommendations, not just backwards metrics

## Template Usage Example

**Topic:** "How we helped a regional bank reduce loan processing time from 14 days to 48 hours"

**STAR Structure:**

- **Situation:** Regional bank with $8B in assets; loan processing took 14 days average due to manual document review, multiple handoff points, and legacy systems. Customer complaints rising; competitors offering 3-day approvals.
- **Task:** Reduce loan processing from 14 days to under 3 days within 9 months, without increasing headcount, while maintaining compliance standards.
- **Action:**
  - Phase 1 -- Process mapping identified 23 handoff points; 11 were redundant
  - Phase 2 -- Designed automated document ingestion using OCR + ML classification (eliminated 60% of manual review)
  - Phase 3 -- Rebuilt approval workflow with parallel processing instead of sequential routing
  - Phase 4 -- Piloted with personal loans, iterated on error rates, then rolled out to mortgage and commercial
  - Key decision: Chose custom ML model over off-shelf due to bank's unique compliance requirements
  - Obstacle: Loan officer resistance overcome through co-design workshops and 4-week shadowing period
- **Result:** Processing time dropped from 14 days to 48 hours (86% reduction). Customer satisfaction rose 31 points. Application volume increased 22% in first quarter. Zero compliance violations in 6-month audit. Follow-on engagement commissioned.

**Slide Count:** 10 slides (Title: 1, Situation: 1, Task: 1, Action: 5, Result: 2)

**Pattern Mapping:**
| Slide | Title | Pattern |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Title Slide | -- |

## Final Pro Tips

1. **Front-load the "so what."** In sales/RFP contexts, consider a 1-slide executive summary before the STAR sequence. State the punchline result upfront, then walk through how you got there.

2. **Quantify at every stage.** Baseline in Situation, targets in Task, interim metrics in Action, outcomes in Result. Replace every "significant" or "improved" with a specific figure.

3. **The Action section is where you win or lose.** "We optimized the process" is worthless. "We mapped 23 handoff points, eliminated 11, and automated document classification" builds trust.

4. **Show your thinking, not just your doing.** "We chose X over Y because..." is more impressive than "We did X." Audiences want to know you can think, not just execute.

5. **One obstacle slide is worth ten success slides.** A flawless story is not believable. Include at least one obstacle and how it was overcome.

6. **Mirror the audience's world.** In sales contexts, choose cases matching the prospect's industry or challenge. The audience should think "that sounds like us."

7. **Close the loop.** The Result slide must use the exact same metrics from Situation and Task. If you set up 58-minute wait times with a 30-minute target, report the actual achieved time.
