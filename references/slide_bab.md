# Slide Pattern F: BAB Mini-Story (Before > After > Bridge)

> **Note:** The `---` dividers in this file are documentation section boundaries. When generating presentation output, use `---` only as slide boundary markers per SKILL.md format rules.

## Pattern Overview

**Designation:** Pattern F (Layer 2 -- Slide-Level Pattern)
**Concept:** Compress a transformation narrative into a single slide by showing the painful "Before" state, the improved "After" state, and the "Bridge" that explains how you got them there.
**Origin:** Copywriting community (Before-After-Bridge formula). Widely used in email marketing, landing pages, and persuasive pitches.
**Best For:** Customer case studies, social proof sections, transformation narratives, portfolio slides showing multiple client outcomes.

**When to Use:**
- You need to demonstrate real-world impact quickly (one slide, not a full case study)
- The audience needs evidence that your approach works
- You have quantifiable Before and After metrics to show contrast
- You are in a proof, social proof, or desire section of a meta-flow
- You need backward-looking proof (what already happened), not forward-looking projection

**When NOT to Use:**
- The transformation lacks quantifiable metrics (vague "it got better")
- You need to explain a complex, multi-phase implementation in detail (use STAR instead)
- The Before and After states are too similar to create meaningful contrast
- The audience needs deep technical understanding of how the solution works
- You need forward-looking projection rather than backward-looking proof (use Monroe Viz or PSB)

## Core Philosophy

**"Show the contrast, then build the bridge."**

The power of the BAB pattern lives in the gap between Before and After. The wider that gap, the more compelling the story. Contrast drives persuasion for three reasons:

1. **Anchoring effect.** When you establish a painful Before state with specific numbers, the audience anchors to those numbers. The After numbers then feel dramatically better by comparison. The Before state sets the baseline against which everything is measured.
2. **Credibility through specificity.** Vague transformation claims trigger skepticism. Mirrored metrics -- the same measures, improved values -- signal you actually tracked the outcome and can prove what changed.
3. **Emotional resonance.** If the prospect recognizes their own pain in the Before column, the After column becomes their aspiration. The Before state is their present; the After state is their future.

The Bridge is not the star. It is the connective tissue -- just enough detail to establish that the transformation was earned, not accidental. The Bridge answers "how?" in 1-3 sentences.

**Design principle:** Before and After should take roughly 80% of the slide's content space. Bridge should take roughly 20%. If the Bridge is growing beyond that, you need a STAR micro-case or multi-slide approach.

**BAB vs STAR Micro distinction:** BAB emphasizes the contrast between states. STAR Micro emphasizes the process (Situation, Task, Action, Result). Use BAB when the dramatic gap is the selling point. Use STAR Micro when the methodology or process is the selling point.

## Detailed Element Guide

### BEFORE Section -- 2-3 specific pain points, quantified

- **Use the customer's language.** If they called it "a nightmare," use that word. Mirror the vocabulary they use internally.
- **Quantify the pain.** Every Before point should have a number. "14-day average processing time" not "slow processing."
- **Be specific, not generic.** "Manual reconciliation of 4 separate databases required 12 FTE-hours per day" not "inefficient processes."
- **Choose metrics that will mirror dramatically in the After section.** The Before/After gap is the selling point -- pick your most dramatic metrics.
- **Include financial impact when available.** "$1.4M annually in rework" makes the pain real.

**Good:** "23% application error rate costing $1.4M annually in rework" / "4 disconnected systems requiring manual data re-entry"
**Bad:** "Processes were inefficient" / "Customer satisfaction was low" / "Things were not working well"

### AFTER Section -- 2-3 specific outcomes, mirrored metrics

- **Mirror the Before points.** Same metrics, improved values. If Before mentions "23% error rate," After must address error rate.
- **Include both business and emotional payoffs.** Lead with the hard metric, layer in human impact.
- **Maintain the same count as Before.** Symmetry reinforces the structure and makes the contrast scannable.
- **Add the delta inline.** "5.5-day processing time (down from 14 days, 60% reduction)" is stronger than just "5.5-day processing time."
- **Maintain the same order as Before.** If Before lists error rate, then processing time, then cost -- After should mirror that exact order.

**Good:** "3% application error rate -- saving $1.2M annually" / "5.5-day average processing time (60% reduction)"
**Bad:** "Errors were significantly reduced" / "The new system works better" / "Client was very satisfied"

**Mirroring Example:**
| Before | After |
|---|---|
| 23% error rate | 3% error rate (down 87%) |
| 14-day processing time | 5.5-day processing time (down 60%) |
| $1.4M annual rework cost | $180K annual rework cost (saving $1.2M) |

### BRIDGE Section -- 1-3 sentences

- **Credit your solution or approach.** Name what made the difference.
- **Be specific about what changed.** "Deployed an automated validation engine integrated with their existing CRM and ERP" not "we implemented our solution."
- **Include timeline if relevant.** "In 8 weeks" or "over a 90-day implementation."
- **Do not re-explain the outcome.** The After section covers that.
- **Keep to ~20% of slide content.** If the Bridge is growing beyond 3 sentences, switch to STAR Micro-Case.

### Contrast Techniques

**Technique 1: Absolute + Relative.** State both the absolute numbers and the percentage change.
- "14 days to 5.5 days (60% reduction)" -- the absolute shows scale, the percentage shows magnitude.

**Technique 2: Financial Translation.** Convert operational metrics into dollars.
- "23% error rate" becomes "23% error rate, costing $1.4M annually in rework"

**Technique 3: Human Impact.** Add one experiential detail alongside the metric.
- "94% same-day shipping" plus "customers receive orders before the weekend instead of the following Tuesday"

**Technique 4: Benchmark Comparison.** Place the After state against an industry standard.
- "0.6% error rate (down from 7.2%) -- now 3x better than industry average of 1.8%"

---

### TITLE -- States the transformation outcome

**Formulas:**
- `[Customer] [achieved outcome] [in timeframe]`
- `[Customer] [verb] [key metric] from [before] to [after]`
- `[Customer] [verb] [delta] [through/via] [approach]`

Must state the transformation outcome, not label the slide as a "case study." Include the customer name (or credible anonymization like "Fortune 500 retailer"), the key metric with before/after delta, and ideally the timeframe.

**Title selection rule:** Choose the single most impressive metric for the title. If you achieved five things, lead with the one that will make the audience lean forward.

## Title Writing Guide

### DO Examples

1. "Acme Corp reduced loan processing time by 60% in 8 weeks"
2. "GlobalTech cut annual customer churn from 18% to 6%"
3. "NovaPay achieved 4x transaction throughput with 70% fewer errors"
4. "Orion Logistics saved $2.1M in freight costs through automated reconciliation"

### DON'T Examples

1. "Case Study: Acme Corp" -- topic label, not a conclusion
2. "Customer Success Story" -- describes the slide type, not the outcome
3. "How We Helped GlobalTech" -- makes you the hero instead of the customer
4. "Before and After" -- describes the structure, not the transformation

## Selecting Cases for BAB

### Choose cases with the strongest contrast

Not every customer story belongs in a BAB slide. Select cases where:

1. **At least one metric shows 2x+ improvement.** A 20% improvement does not create the visual and emotional impact BAB requires. If your best metric shows 60-90% improvement, the pattern will work.

2. **Before and After can both be quantified.** If you have great After numbers but vague Before state ("things were slow"), the contrast cannot be built. You need numbers on both sides.

3. **The Bridge is simple.** If explaining how you got from Before to After takes a paragraph, use STAR Micro instead. BAB needs a 1-3 sentence Bridge.

4. **The case matches the audience's world.** A retail case for a retail prospect. A SaaS case for a SaaS prospect. Industry matching multiplies the emotional resonance of the Before state.

5. **The customer is nameable or credibly anonymizable.** "Fortune 500 retailer ($12B revenue)" works. "A company" does not.

### Case Ranking Rule

When you have multiple cases to choose from, rank by: (1) industry match to audience, (2) dramatic contrast in headline metric, (3) relevance of the problem to the audience's current situation, (4) recency.

## Before/After Examples

### Example 1: SaaS Customer Success

**BEFORE (flat):**
```
Title: "Case Study: TechStart Inc."
TechStart Inc. was experiencing challenges with their customer
onboarding process. After implementing our platform, they saw
improvements in onboarding completion rates and satisfaction.
```

**AFTER (compelling BAB):**
```
Title: "TechStart increased onboarding completion from
       34% to 89% in 9 weeks"

BEFORE
- 34% onboarding completion rate
- 47-day average time-to-value
- NPS of 18 among new customers

AFTER
- 89% onboarding completion rate (+162%)
- 11-day average time-to-value (down 77%)
- NPS of 72 among new customers (+300%)

BRIDGE: Replaced manual onboarding with guided in-app
workflows and automated milestone tracking. Full rollout
in 9 weeks with zero disruption to existing customers.
```

### Example 2: Operational Improvement

**BEFORE (flat):**
```
Title: "Warehouse Operations Project"
We worked with Pacific Fulfillment to improve their warehouse
operations. Results included faster order fulfillment and reduced errors.
```

**AFTER (compelling BAB):**
```
Title: "Pacific Fulfillment cut order errors by 91% and
       ships same-day for 94% of orders"

BEFORE
- 7.2% order error rate (mispicks, wrong qty)
- 38% of orders shipped same-day
- $840K annual cost of returns and re-ships

AFTER
- 0.6% order error rate (down 91%)
- 94% of orders shipped same-day (up 147%)
- $72K annual returns cost (down 91%, saving $768K)

BRIDGE: Deployed zone-based pick-to-light system and
reorganized warehouse into velocity-based zones. 6-week
implementation, no fulfillment downtime.
```

## Variations by Audience

| Audience | Priorities | Key Adaptations |
|---|---|---|
| **Executive** | ROI, bottom-line impact, speed | Lead with financial metrics; include ROI or payback period; Bridge to single sentence; Metrics Table layout |
| **Technical** | Implementation detail, performance metrics | Technical Before/After metrics (latency, throughput, uptime); Bridge slightly longer with technology mentions |
| **Sales / Prospect** | Relevance, achievability, time to value | Choose case matching prospect's industry; emphasize ease of implementation; Story Card layout if quote available |
| **Internal / Retrospective** | Lessons learned, replicability | Include process/team metrics alongside business outcomes; Bridge includes what worked and what would change |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Weak contrast.** Before and After too similar -- a 20% improvement is not compelling for this pattern. Fix: choose the metrics with the most dramatic improvement, aiming for at least 2x on one metric. If no metric shows dramatic contrast, consider whether BAB is the right pattern.
2. **Unquantified outcomes.** "Customer satisfaction improved significantly." Fix: replace every adjective with a number. "Significantly" is the enemy of persuasion.
3. **Before/After metrics do not mirror.** Before mentions error rates but After mentions satisfaction scores. Fix: same metrics, improved values, same order. The audience should be able to scan down both columns and see the direct correspondence.
4. **Bridge too vague.** "We implemented our solution." Fix: name the specific solution, approach, or methodology that made the transformation happen.
5. **Too many points (>3 per section).** Creates clutter and weakens the visual contrast. Fix: limit to 2-3 per section, move additional detail to speaker notes or appendix.
6. **Bridge overshadows the contrast.** Bridge takes more space than Before and After combined, turning the slide into a methodology explanation. Fix: keep Bridge at roughly 20% of slide content. If the Bridge needs more space, use STAR Micro instead.
7. **Title describes slide type instead of outcome.** "Case Study: Acme Corp" is a label. Fix: lead with the customer name and the headline metric: "[Customer] [achieved what] [in how long]."

## Pro Tips

1. **Write After first.** Nail the outcome metrics, then work backward to construct the Before state using the same metrics. This ensures mirroring and guarantees the contrast is dramatic.
2. **Use the same units in Before and After.** If Before measures "days to process," After must measure "days to process" -- not "percentage improvement." Consistent units make the contrast scannable.
3. **The Bridge should be 20% of the slide space.** If it is growing beyond three sentences, switch to STAR micro-case or a two-slide BAB where the Bridge gets its own slide.
4. **One BAB per slide, multiple BABs per section.** 2-4 BAB slides in sequence creates a powerful "wall of evidence" effect. Each slide is a different customer or engagement, all following the same structure.
5. **Match the Before state to your audience's current pain.** The audience should think "that sounds like us" when reading the Before section. If they do, the After section becomes their aspiration. This is where industry-matching matters most.
6. **Add the delta inline.** Write "5.5-day processing time (down from 14 days, 60% reduction)" rather than just "5.5-day processing time." The delta makes the contrast explicit even if the reader does not look back at the Before section.
7. **Test the title as a standalone headline.** Cover the slide body and read only the title. Does it tell a complete, compelling transformation story? If not, the title is not doing its job.
