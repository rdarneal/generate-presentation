# Three-Act Structure Presentation Template

> **Note:** The `---` dividers in this file are documentation section boundaries. When generating presentation output, use `---` only as slide boundary markers per SKILL.md format rules.

## Framework Overview
**Origin:** Classical dramatic storytelling (Aristotle, Syd Field); adapted for business presentations by Nancy Duarte (*Resonate*), Garr Reynolds, and others
**Best For:** Keynotes, vision talks, transformation stories, brand narratives, customer success journeys
**Audience:** General audiences, conferences, all-hands meetings, investors (narrative-driven pitches), customers
**Duration:** 5-15 slides (10-30 minutes typical)

## Core Philosophy
**Make the audience the hero.** Your presentation is not about your product, your company, or your data. It is about the audience's world, their struggle, and their transformation. Your solution is the guide that makes the hero's journey possible.

**Key Insight (Duarte's Sparkline):** Alternate between "what is" (current pain) and "what could be" (aspirational future). The contrast creates the tension that pulls the audience forward.

---

## Emotional Arc

**Trajectory:** Comfort -> Disruption -> Rising tension -> Crisis (lowest point) -> Breakthrough -> Inspiration -> Call to action

**Key transition:** The crisis must feel genuine and specific before the resolution, or the breakthrough rings hollow.

**Sparkline rule:** Alternate between "what is" (current pain) and "what could be" (aspirational future) throughout Act 2. No more than 3-4 slides without a shift.

---

## Slide Structure Template

### TITLE SLIDE
**Elements:**
- Presentation title (evocative, not descriptive)
- Subtitle or tagline that hints at transformation
- Date, presenter, event/occasion

**Title Patterns:**
*"From the Brink: How One Decision Changed Everything"*
*"The Future We Almost Missed"*

---

## ACT 1: SETUP (25% of deck, ~2-3 slides)

**Purpose:** Establish the world, introduce the hero, and shatter the status quo with an inciting incident that demands a response.

### THE HERO'S WORLD (1 slide)

**Purpose:** Introduce the protagonist (the audience, the customer, the industry) and their ordinary world.

**Content Requirements:**
- Paint a vivid picture of the starting state
- Use specific, relatable details the audience recognizes as their own experience
- Establish credibility by demonstrating deep understanding of their world
- Audience is the hero, not the presenter or the company

**Title Patterns:**
*"In 2019, every retailer believed the same thing about their customers"*
*"For 20 years, the playbook for growth looked exactly the same"*

**Slide Pattern:** SCQA Micro-Narrative (Situation portion) or narrative

---

### THE STATUS QUO (Optional -- combine with Hero's World or omit)

**Purpose:** Deepen the audience's connection to the starting state. Show what was working, what was assumed, what felt stable.

**Content Requirements:**
- Metrics or milestones that defined success in the old world
- Shared beliefs or industry assumptions

**Title Patterns:**
*"Growth was steady, margins were healthy, and nobody questioned the model"*
*"The old approach worked well enough that no one looked for a better one"*

**Slide Pattern:** SCQA Micro-Narrative or Pyramid Principle

---

### THE INCITING INCIDENT (1-2 slides)

**Purpose:** Shatter the status quo. Introduce the change, threat, or opportunity that makes the old world unsustainable.

**Content Requirements:**
- A specific, concrete event or shift (not a vague trend)
- Data or evidence that the old model is breaking
- The moment of recognition: "This changes everything"
- Create urgency without panic

**Title Patterns:**
*"Then in March 2023, everything we believed was proven wrong"*
*"A single customer email revealed a crack in our entire foundation"*

**Slide Pattern:** SCQA Micro-Narrative (Complication and Question portions)

---

### THE STAKES (Optional -- combine with Inciting Incident for shorter decks)

**Purpose:** Make explicit what is at risk if the hero fails to respond.

**Content Requirements:**
- Quantified consequences of inaction
- Personal or organizational stakes
- Time pressure or competitive threat

**Title Patterns:**
*"Without a response, we faced losing 40% of our customer base within 18 months"*
*"The window to act was measured in quarters, not years"*

---

## ACT 2: CONFRONTATION (50% of deck, ~3-6 slides)

**Purpose:** Take the hero through escalating challenges, obstacles, and setbacks. Build tension through the midpoint revelation, increase stakes, and drive to the crisis.

### RISING OBSTACLES (1-2 slides)

**Purpose:** Show the first wave of challenges. The hero begins to respond but faces resistance.

**Content Requirements:**
- Specific obstacles, not abstractions
- Failed or incomplete first attempts (authenticity builds trust)

## Common Patterns by Narrative Type

### Company Origin Story
1. **Act 1:** Founders see a broken system or unmet need; the world before your company existed
2. **Act 2:** Early failures, pivots, near-death moments, the insight that changed everything
3. **Act 3:** The company today, customer impact, the mission going forward

### Digital Transformation Journey
1. **Act 1:** Legacy systems and processes; the competitive threat that forced change
2. **Act 2:** Resistance to change, failed implementations, the breakthrough approach
3. **Act 3:** The transformed organization, measurable improvements, competitive advantage gained

### Customer Success Journey
1. **Act 1:** The customer's world before your solution; their pain and limitations
2. **Act 2:** The search for a solution, failed alternatives, the adoption challenge
3. **Act 3:** Transformation achieved, quantified impact, the customer's new reality

## Adaptation Notes

**Standard Decks (8-12 slides):**
- Act 1: 2-3 slides (hero's world + inciting incident, combine status quo into hero's world)
- Act 2: 3-5 slides (rising obstacles, midpoint revelation, crisis — combine increasing stakes with adjacent sections)
- Act 3: 2-3 slides (climax + results + call to action, combine denouement with results)
- The sparkline should oscillate 2-3 times

**Compact Decks (3-7 slides):**
- Act 1: 1-2 slides (setup + inciting incident on one slide)
- Act 2: 1-2 slides (key obstacle + crisis)
- Act 3: 1-2 slides (breakthrough + results)

**Extended Decks (13-15 slides):**
- Act 1: 2-3 slides (richer scene-setting)
- Act 2: 5-6 slides (more sparkline oscillations)
- Act 3: 3-4 slides (more proof points and customer voices)
- Maximum 15 slides; move additional material to appendix

**For Executive Audiences:**
- Move faster through Act 1; strengthen data in Acts 2 and 3
- Make the call to action specific and decision-oriented
- Consider an executive summary slide before Act 1 (hybrid with Pyramid)

**For All-Hands / Internal Audiences:**
- Emphasize "we" language (the hero is the team, not leadership)
- Include authentic failure and vulnerability
- Make the denouement about the team's future, not just business metrics

**For Investor Pitches:**
- Act 1: Market context and the gap you discovered
- Act 2: Why existing solutions fail, your unique insight, early traction challenges
- Act 3: Current traction, growth metrics, vision for scale

## Template Usage Example

**Topic:** "How Meridian Health Transformed Patient Outcomes Through Digital Innovation"
*Context: 30-minute keynote at a healthcare technology conference*

**Three-Act Structure:**

### Act 1: Setup (3 slides)
| Slide | Title | Pattern | Content |
|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Title Slide | — | "The Hospital That Learned to Listen" / Healthcare Innovation Summit 2026 |
| 2 | "Five years ago, Meridian Health looked like every mid-size hospital network — steady growth, traditional operations, and nobody was worried" | SCQA Micro (Situation) | Paint the picture: 12 hospitals, 4,200 beds; metrics that seemed acceptable |
| 3 | "Then Sarah Chen was readmitted for the third time in six months — and her case wasn't an anomaly, it was the system working exactly as designed" | SCQA Micro (Complication) | Inciting incident + stakes: 23% of readmissions preventable, $18M annual cost, regulatory penalties approaching |

### Act 2: Confrontation (6 slides)
| Slide | Title | Pattern | Content |
|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| 4 | "The first attempt to fix the problem made it worse — an $8M EHR integration added 40 minutes to nurse workflows" | BAB Mini-Story | Early failure + vision of what coordinated care could look like (sparkline) |
| 5 | "The real problem was not the technology — it was who they were building it for" | SCQA Micro (Reframe) | **Midpoint revelation:** Building for administrators, not patients or clinicians |
| 6 | "While Meridian rebuilt, competitors launched their own platforms and the pilot results were mixed at best" | Narrative | Rising stakes: competitive pressure, adoption at 34%, physicians vocal critics |
| 7 | "In June, the board called an emergency review — the recommendation: shut down the initiative" | Narrative | **Crisis:** $12M spent, mixed results, real possibility of failure |
| 8 | "One data point saved the program: patients in the pilot had 41% fewer readmissions" | Pyramid (action title) | The data that earned 90 more days (sparkline: what could be) |
| 9 | "This time, they did something different: they asked the nurses to lead" | SCQA Micro | **Climax:** The breakthrough decision that changed the trajectory |

### Act 3: Resolution (4 slides)
| Slide | Title | Pattern | Content |
|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| 10 | "In 90 days, adoption went from 34% to 89% — not because of the technology, but because of who owned it" | STAR Micro-Case | Breakthrough result: nurse-led implementation, workflow redesign from the ground up |
| 11 | "Readmissions dropped 52%, patient satisfaction reached the 95th percentile, and Sarah Chen's story now ends differently" | Pyramid (action title) | Quantified results + narrative closure: readmissions, satisfaction, $22M/year savings, Sarah's outcome |
| 12 | "Three lessons any healthcare system can apply today — and why Meridian is just getting started" | Pyramid (action title) | Lessons learned + forward vision: behavioral health, predictive genomics, community health |
| 13 | "What could your version of this story look like?" | Narrative | Call to action + contact: invitation to begin their own transformation |

**Total:** 13 slides
**Duration:** ~20 minutes
**Sparkline oscillations:** 3 across Act 2

## Final Pro Tips

1. **Open with a person, not a statistic.** Introduce a specific character in the first two slides. Data can come later; empathy cannot wait.

2. **Earn the resolution.** Spend the most time crafting Act 2. If the obstacles and crisis aren't genuine, the resolution feels manufactured.

3. **Close the loop.** Bring back a specific element from Act 1 in the resolution — a character, a metric, a belief — to create narrative closure.

4. **Use silence at transitions.** Pause after the inciting incident, crisis, and climax. In a deck, use visual-only or stark single-sentence slides at act transitions.

5. **Your product is Gandalf, not Frodo.** Your solution is the guide, not the hero. The moment your product becomes the protagonist, the audience becomes a spectator.

6. **Test with the "dinner party" rule.** Read slide titles out loud in sequence. If they sound like a table of contents, rewrite them; if they sound like a story, you're on track.

7. **End on the future, not the past.** The denouement should point forward. Leave the audience with a vision of what comes next, not a summary of what happened.
