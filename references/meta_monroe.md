# Monroe's Motivated Sequence Presentation Template

> **Note:** The `---` dividers in this file are documentation section boundaries. When generating presentation output, use `---` only as slide boundary markers per SKILL.md format rules.

## Framework Overview
**Origin:** Alan H. Monroe, Purdue University, 1930s — developed as a persuasive speech structure rooted in the psychology of motivation
**Best For:** Change advocacy, behavior change campaigns, internal change management, health/safety/social cause presentations, motivational talks
**Audience:** General audiences, internal teams, community groups, leadership seeking buy-in for change initiatives
**Duration:** 5-15 slides (10-30 minutes typical)

## Core Philosophy
Make the audience feel the problem, see the solution, imagine their transformed future, and act immediately.

---

## Emotional Arc

**Trajectory:** Curiosity (attention) -> Concern (need) -> Relief (satisfaction) -> Aspiration/urgency (visualization) -> Commitment (action)

**Key transition:** The shift from Satisfaction to Visualization is Monroe's signature move — the audience must vividly experience the future before being asked to commit.

---

## Slide Structure Template

### 1. TITLE SLIDE
**Elements:**
- Presentation title (often a provocative or aspirational statement)
- Subtitle hinting at the change being advocated
- Date, presenter, organization

**Title Pattern:**
*"It's Time to Rethink How We Onboard: A Case for the First 90 Days"*

---

### 2. ATTENTION (1-2 slides, ~10% of deck)
**Purpose:** Disrupt the audience's default state. Grab their interest immediately and establish emotional relevance.

**Content Requirements:**
- A compelling hook: startling statistic, vivid story, provocative question, or striking image
- Immediate audience relevance — the hook must connect to their world
- Brief framing of why this topic matters right now

**Title Patterns:**
*"Every 6 seconds, one of our employees considers quitting"*
*"What if the biggest risk to our growth is something we can fix in 90 days?"*

---

### 3-5. NEED (2-3 slides, ~25% of deck)
**Purpose:** Establish that a real, urgent problem exists — and that it directly affects the audience.

**Content Requirements:**
- Clear problem statement with evidence
- Data quantifying the scope and severity of the problem
- Personal relevance: show how the problem touches the audience directly
- Consequences of inaction (preview of what happens if nothing changes)

**Title Patterns:**
*"New hire turnover costs us $2.3M annually — and it's accelerating"*
*"68% of employees say their onboarding experience was 'poor' or 'nonexistent'"*

**Typical Slide Breakdown:**

**Problem Statement Slide:**
```
THE PROBLEM
[Clear, specific statement of the issue]

SCOPE
[How widespread — numbers, percentages, affected groups]

TREND
[Is it getting worse? How fast?]
```

**Consequences of Inaction Slide (optional, for longer decks):**
```
IF WE DO NOTHING
[Projected cost, risk, or deterioration]

WHO IS AFFECTED
[Specific groups, roles, or outcomes at stake]

URGENCY
[Why the window for action is closing]
```

---

### 6-8. SATISFACTION (2-4 slides, ~25% of deck)
**Purpose:** Present a practical, credible solution that directly addresses every dimension of the need.

**Content Requirements:**
- Clear statement of the proposed solution
- Explanation of how it works (mechanism, process, or approach)
- Evidence that the solution is feasible (pilots, case studies, research)
- Direct mapping: show how each aspect of the Need is addressed
- Preemptive objection handling (address the top 1-2 concerns)

**Title Patterns:**
*"A structured 90-day onboarding program reduces early turnover by 40%"*
*"Three changes to our safety protocol eliminate the top cause of incidents"*

**Typical Structure (Solution Overview):**
```
PROPOSED SOLUTION
[One clear sentence describing the change]

HOW IT WORKS
[2-3 bullet summary of key components or steps]

EXPECTED OUTCOME
[Quantified result or goal]
```

---

### 9-11. VISUALIZATION (2-3 slides, ~25% of deck)
**Purpose:** Help the audience vividly imagine the future — both with and without the proposed solution.

**Three Visualization Approaches:**

#### Approach A: Positive Visualization (use when audience is already open to change)
*"Imagine onboarding that makes new hires productive in 30 days instead of 90"*
- Vivid, specific description of life after the change
- Tangible outcomes quantified
- Experiential language: what people see, feel, and do differently

#### Approach B: Negative Visualization (use when audience is complacent or resistant)
*"Without action, we lose another 340 employees and $4.6M by year-end"*
- Projected deterioration — specific and time-bound
- Cascading consequences (first, second, third-order effects)
- The human cost behind the numbers

#### Approach C: Contrast Visualization (recommended default)
*"Two futures: the choice is ours to make in the next 60 days"*

**Typical Structure:**
```
WITH THE SOLUTION                    WITHOUT THE SOLUTION
─────────────────────                ─────────────────────
[Positive outcome 1]                [Negative outcome 1]
[Positive outcome 2]                [Negative outcome 2]
[Positive outcome 3]                [Negative outcome 3]

BOTTOM LINE
[Single sentence crystallizing the stakes of the decision]
```

- Use two-column layout for maximum impact
- Keep each scenario to 3-4 specific, concrete points
- Be vivid and specific: "New hires close their first deal in week 3" beats "Onboarding will improve"

---

### 12-13. ACTION (1-2 slides, ~15% of deck)
**Purpose:** Convert emotional momentum into concrete commitment.

**Content Requirements:**
- Specific, actionable next steps (not vague aspirations)
- Clear ownership: who does what
- Timeline with immediate first action
- Low barrier to entry: make the first step easy
- Brief callback to Visualization stakes

**Title Patterns:**
*"Approve the pilot program by March 15 and we launch April 1"*
*"Three actions this week that set the change in motion"*

**Typical Structure:**
```
WHAT WE NEED
[Specific decision, approval, or commitment requested]

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP
[The single action the audience can take today or this week]

TIMELINE
[Key dates and milestones]
```

---

## Common Patterns by Advocacy Type

### Process Change
1. **Attention:** Cost of current process failures (shocking metric)
2. **Need:** Inefficiency data, error rates, employee frustration metrics
3. **Satisfaction:** New process design with pilot results
4. **Visualization:** Contrast — streamlined workflow vs. continued chaos
5. **Action:** Approve pilot expansion, assign process owners, set review date

### Technology Adoption
1. **Attention:** Competitor advantage or market shift enabled by technology
2. **Need:** Current technology gaps, manual workaround costs, scalability limits
3. **Satisfaction:** Technology solution with implementation plan and integration details
4. **Visualization:** Contrast — automated efficiency vs. growing technical debt
5. **Action:** Approve procurement, form implementation team, begin training timeline

### Culture Change
1. **Attention:** Employee voice — quote or survey result that reveals the gap
2. **Need:** Engagement data, attrition patterns, exit interview themes
3. **Satisfaction:** Culture initiative with behavioral anchors and leadership commitments
4. **Visualization:** Contrast — thriving team culture vs. continued talent drain
5. **Action:** Leadership commitment signing, team workshops scheduled, pulse survey baseline

## Adaptation Notes

**Shorter Talks (5-8 slides):**
- Combine Attention and Need into a single powerful opening (1-2 slides)
- Satisfaction compressed to 2 slides (solution + one proof point)
- Visualization reduced to 1 contrast slide
- Action in 1 slide with a single clear ask

**Extended Talks (13-15 slides):**
- Expand Need section with additional data angles (max 3 slides)
- Use all three visualization approaches across multiple slides
- Include implementation roadmap in Action section
- Maximum 15 slides; move supporting data to appendix

**For Skeptical Audiences:**
- Strengthen Need with third-party data and benchmarks
- Add more proof points in Satisfaction
- Lead Visualization with negative scenario before positive
- Make Action steps reversible or low-risk (pilot, trial)

**For Executive Audiences:**
- Lead Attention with business impact, not emotional stories
- Quantify Need in financial terms
- Frame Satisfaction as ROI-positive with clear payback timeline
- Make Action about decisions and resource allocation

## Final Pro Tips

1. **The Visualization section is your competitive advantage.** Most presenters skip it. A vivid visualization separates Monroe's Sequence from a generic problem-solution pitch.

2. **Match visualization approach to audience resistance.** Negative for complacent audiences, positive for aligned audiences, contrast for mixed or undecided. When in doubt, use contrast.

3. **Every Need must have a Satisfaction.** Unresolved needs create anxiety without direction, undermining your credibility and call to action.

4. **Make the first action absurdly easy.** "Reply to this email saying yes" beats "Approve the budget." Reduce friction to build momentum.

5. **Quantify relentlessly, but narrate the numbers.** "$2.3M — enough to fund the entire new product team we've been requesting for two years" is better than "$2.3M."

6. **Test with the title-only read.** Titles in sequence should read as a complete persuasive argument: hook, problem, solution, future, action.

7. **Calibrate emotional intensity to your credibility.** If new to the audience, lean on data and proof. If trusted, lean on narrative and visualization.
