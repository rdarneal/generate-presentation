# Slide Pattern J: Problem-Solution-Benefit (PSB) Slide Pattern

> **Note:** The `---` dividers in this file are documentation section boundaries. When generating presentation output, use `---` only as slide boundary markers per SKILL.md format rules.

## Pattern Overview

**Designation:** Pattern J (Layer 2 -- Slide-Level Pattern)
**Concept:** A three-part slide structure that states a problem, presents a solution, and quantifies the benefit -- the most direct persuasion pattern available.
**Origin:** Common B2B and executive presentation pattern; widely used across sales, consulting, and operational contexts.
**Best For:** Quick-pitch slides, feature highlights, recommendation slides, executive updates, action items, initiative summaries.

**When to Use:**
- The audience already understands the general context and does not need extensive framing
- You need direct, efficient persuasion -- no narrative arc, no emotional build
- The slide must stand alone as a self-contained argument
- You are presenting multiple items that each need a quick case (features, initiatives, action items)
- Time is limited and every slide must earn its place with a clear payoff

**When NOT to Use:**
- The audience needs extensive context before they can understand the problem -- use SCQA Micro (Pattern E) instead
- Emotional persuasion or transformation narrative is needed -- use BAB (Pattern F) or Monroe's Visualization (Pattern G)
- You are showcasing a product capability where the starting point is the feature -- use FAB (Pattern C)
- The problem requires root cause analysis -- use 5 Whys Cascade (Pattern H)
- The slide is purely analytical with no recommendation -- use Pyramid (Pattern A) or WSWNW (Pattern B)

## Core Philosophy

**Simple, direct, complete.**

PSB is the workhorse pattern of business presentations. It works anywhere you need to make a quick, logical case: here is the problem, here is the fix, here is the payoff. No narrative arc. No emotional escalation. No elaborate framing. Just clear logic that the audience can absorb in seconds.

Its strength is **efficiency.** A well-built PSB slide delivers the full argument -- pain, remedy, reward -- in a single glance. The audience does not need to hold multiple slides in working memory or wait for a reveal. They get the complete picture immediately.

**When simplicity beats sophistication:**
1. **Volume contexts.** When presenting five recommendations or twelve initiative updates, each needs a fast, repeatable structure. PSB scales where narrative patterns cannot. You cannot run a Three-Act arc for each of twelve budget line items.
2. **Informed audiences.** When the audience already lives with the problem, state it to anchor the slide, present your solution, and quantify the benefit. The less time you spend telling informed people what they already know, the more credible you appear.
3. **Decision-support contexts.** Executives scanning for go/no-go signals need the logic chain exposed: if this problem exists and this solution addresses it, then this benefit follows. The structure itself is the argument.
4. **Mixed decks.** PSB is ideal for individual slides within larger meta-flows -- recommendations in SCQA Support, countermeasures in 5 Whys, value props in Challenger Sale, action items in any deck.

**The acid test:** Can you state the Problem in one sentence, the Solution in one sentence, and the Benefit in one number? If yes, PSB is the right pattern. If any of those three requires a paragraph of context, you need a more elaborate pattern.

**PSB vs FAB distinction:** PSB starts with the customer's problem. FAB starts with your feature. Use PSB when the audience feels the pain and needs a fix. Use FAB when the audience is evaluating capabilities and needs value translation.

## Detailed Element Guide

### PROBLEM -- 1-3 lines, quantified, recognizable

The Problem statement anchors the slide. It tells the audience why this slide exists.

- **Specific and quantified.** "$2M annual loss from manual invoice errors across 14,000 monthly transactions" not "inefficient processes."
- **Use the audience's language.** Mirror their vocabulary so the problem registers instantly. If they call it "shrinkage," do not call it "inventory discrepancy."
- **One problem per PSB unit.** Multiple problems need multiple PSB units or a Multi-PSB slide.
- **The problem should be recognizable.** The audience should read it and think "yes, that is a real issue." If you need to prove the problem exists, PSB is the wrong pattern -- use SCQA Micro first.

**Good:** "$2M annual loss from manual invoice processing errors across 14,000 monthly transactions" / "Sales team spends 35% of selling time on manual CRM data entry instead of prospect engagement"
**Bad:** "We have some issues with our processes" / "There are inefficiencies"

### SOLUTION -- 1-3 lines, concrete, connected to Problem

The Solution is your answer to the Problem. It must connect directly and obviously to the stated pain.

- **Concrete, not vague.** "Deploy AI-powered invoice matching that auto-validates against PO data" not "leverage our platform."
- **Connect directly to the Problem stated.** If the Problem is about processing errors, the Solution must address processing errors.
- **Name your product, feature, or approach.** Be specific enough that the audience can picture what changes.
- **Do not over-explain.** Establish credibility and direction; detailed implementation belongs on a separate slide. Keep at "credibility level," not "specification level."
- **Include timeline if brief.** "Deploy in 8 weeks" or "live in 6 weeks" adds credibility without consuming space.

**Good:** "Deploy AI-powered invoice matching system that auto-validates against PO data and routes exceptions to human review" / "Integrate Salesforce Einstein Activity Capture to auto-log emails, calls, and meetings"
**Bad:** "Leverage our platform to improve efficiency" / "Implement best practices" / "Use technology to solve this"

**Solution credibility test:** Would the audience believe this could actually be built and deployed? If the Solution sounds like hand-waving, add one specific detail. If it sounds like a project plan, remove detail.

### BENEFIT -- 1-2 lines, always quantified

The Benefit is the payoff. It answers "what is in it for me?" and closes the logical chain.

- **Must include numbers.** Dollars saved, percentage improved, time reduced. "Improves efficiency" is not a Benefit.
- **Must logically flow from the Solution.** If the Solution automates invoices, the Benefit must relate to invoice outcomes.
- **Frame in terms the audience cares about.** Executives want ROI; technical leads want performance metrics; operations wants throughput.
- **Answer "what is in it for me?" not "what does it do."** "Processes invoices 5x faster" is an Advantage (FAB territory). "$1.8M annual savings from eliminating error remediation" is a Benefit.
- **Be credible.** Wild claims destroy trust. Include the basis when possible: "$1.8M savings based on FY2025 error remediation costs."

**Good:** "92% error reduction | $1.8M annual savings | 2.4 FTEs redeployed to strategic procurement" / "35% selling time recovered | equivalent to adding 12 FTE reps at zero headcount cost"
**Bad:** "Improved efficiency" / "Better customer experience"

### TITLE -- States Benefit or Problem-to-Benefit connection

**Formulas:**
- `[Solution] eliminates [Problem], delivering [Benefit]`
- `[Benefit] through [Solution]`
- `Fixing [Problem] yields [quantified Benefit]`
- `[Solution] [reduces/recovers/eliminates] [specific metric]`

Rules: 8-15 words ideal, never exceed 18. Must pass the "so what" test. No hedge words (may, could, might, significant, various).

**Title selection rule:** Lead with the Benefit whenever possible. The audience cares about what they gain, not what the problem was. If the Benefit is dramatic, put it first. If the Problem-to-Benefit transformation is the story, use the "Fixing X yields Y" formula.

---

## Logical Chain Validation

### The "Because-Should-Deliver" Test

Read the slide as a single sentence: "Because [Problem], we should [Solution], which will deliver [Benefit]."

**Passing:** "Because manual invoice processing generates $2M in annual errors, we should deploy AI-powered invoice matching, which will deliver $1.8M in annual savings and 92% error reduction."

**Failing:** "Because our infrastructure is aging, we should implement best practices, which will deliver improved efficiency." -- Every element is vague. The chain passes syntactically but fails on specificity.

### Three Signs the Chain Is Broken

1. **The Solution addresses a different problem than the one stated.** Problem mentions errors but Solution addresses speed.
2. **The Benefit measures something the Solution does not affect.** Solution automates invoices but Benefit reports employee morale.
3. **Any element could describe a different company's slide.** If a competitor could use the same Problem, Solution, and Benefit, you are not specific enough.

## Title Writing Guide

### DO Examples

1. "Automated invoice matching saves $1.8M annually and eliminates 92% of processing errors"
2. "Structured onboarding program cuts first-year churn from 22% to 9%"
3. "CRM automation recovers 35% of selling time -- equivalent to 12 additional reps"
4. "CI/CD migration reduces deployment cycle from 6 weeks to 3 days"

### DON'T Examples

1. "Process Improvement Recommendation" -- a label, not a conclusion
2. "Invoice Processing Update" -- what about invoice processing?
3. "Proposed Solution" -- for what? with what outcome?
4. "Efficiency Initiative" -- meaningless without specifics

## Before/After Examples

### Example 1: Process Improvement Recommendation

**BEFORE:**
```
Title: "Invoice Processing Improvement"
* We have issues with invoice processing
* Manual process is error-prone
* We should consider automation
* This would help reduce errors
* Technology solutions are available
```

**AFTER:**
```
Title: "Automated invoice matching saves $1.8M annually by
eliminating 92% of processing errors"

PROBLEM:
Manual invoice processing across 14,000 monthly transactions
generates $2M in annual errors and requires 3 FTEs dedicated
to reconciliation

SOLUTION:
Deploy AI-powered invoice matching system that auto-validates
against PO data and routes exceptions-only to human review

BENEFIT:
92% error reduction | $1.8M annual savings |
2.4 FTEs redeployed to strategic procurement

```

### Example 2: Feature Recommendation (Sales Context)

**BEFORE:**
```
Title: "Activity Tracking Feature"
* Our platform tracks activities
* This is better than manual tracking
* Salespeople will save time
* Integrates with email
* Customers like this feature
```

**AFTER:**
```
Title: "CRM automation recovers 35% of selling time lost to
manual data entry -- equivalent to 12 additional reps"

PROBLEM:
Sales reps spend 35% of their day on manual CRM data entry
(emails, calls, meetings), reducing active selling time to
just 4.2 hours per day

SOLUTION:
Salesforce Einstein Activity Capture auto-logs all emails,
calls, and calendar events -- eliminating manual entry while
maintaining complete activity records

BENEFIT:
35% selling time recovered | equivalent to adding 12 FTE reps
at zero headcount cost | projected $4.8M incremental pipeline
per quarter

## Variations by Audience

| Audience | Problem Focus | Solution Focus | Benefit Focus | Title Style |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Executive** | Brief, quantified in dollars or strategic impact | High-level approach, not implementation detail | ROI, payback period, strategic leverage | Benefit-forward, board-memo headline |
| **Technical** | System names, architectures, performance metrics | Architecture-level specificity, named technologies | Latency, throughput, uptime, deployment frequency | Can reference technical specifics |
| **Sales / Prospect** | Customer's pain in their language and metrics | What it does for them, not technical specs | Customer outcomes with proof points | Customer-value focused, "I want that" |
| **Internal / Ops** | Process-specific, actual workflow and bottleneck | Implementation-specific with timeline and owners | Workload reduction, error reduction, time recovered | Process-improvement focused |

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Problem and Benefit do not connect.** Problem states invoice errors but Benefit measures employee satisfaction. Fix: Benefit must measure what the Problem describes. The logical chain must be traceable: Problem A -> Solution for A -> Benefit from solving A.
2. **Solution too vague.** "Leverage our platform to improve operations" could describe any company's work. Fix: name the specific approach, tool, or method. The audience should be able to picture what changes.
3. **Unquantified Benefit.** "Significantly improves efficiency" is not a Benefit -- it is a hope. Fix: replace every adjective with a number. If you cannot quantify the Benefit, the recommendation may not be ready.
4. **Problem not relevant to this audience.** Presenting AP headcount concerns to a CTO who does not manage AP. Fix: reframe the same underlying issue in the audience's terms. Same problem, different framing per role.
5. **Too much detail in Solution.** Turns into a 4-phase implementation plan that belongs on a separate slide. Fix: keep at "credibility level" -- 1-2 sentences naming the approach. Enough for the audience to think "yes, this could work," not enough to build it.

- [ ] Solution names the approach, tool, or method (not vague platitudes)
- [ ] Benefit is quantified with numbers (dollars, percentages, time, headcount)
- [ ] Benefit logically flows from Solution and answers "what is in it for me?"
- [ ] Benefit is credible (not wildly optimistic or unsupported)
- [ ] Title states the Benefit or Problem-to-Benefit connection as a complete sentence
- [ ] Title is 8-15 words, contains no hedge words, passes the "so what" test
- [ ] All three elements present and logical chain holds: Problem -> Solution -> Benefit
- [ ] A reader can understand the complete argument in 10 seconds or less

## Pro Tips

1. **Write the Benefit first.** If you cannot quantify the payoff, reconsider the recommendation. Work backward: what Solution produces this Benefit? What Problem does it solve? If the chain does not hold, the PSB is not ready.
2. **PSB is perfect for "one more thing" slides.** Quick win at the close of a presentation -- delivers the full argument in one slide with no setup required. The audience leaves with a concrete, memorable takeaway.
3. **Use PSB for each item in a recommendation list.** Forces rigor: every recommendation must have a clear problem and quantified benefit. Recommendations that cannot fill out PSB probably do not belong in the deck. This is PSB's most valuable discipline.
4. **The Problem should be something the audience already believes.** If you need to convince them the problem exists, use SCQA Micro first to establish the problem, then transition to PSB for the recommendation. PSB assumes shared understanding of the pain.
5. **Test the logical chain by reading aloud.** "Because [Problem], we should [Solution], which will deliver [Benefit]." If that sentence sounds logical and complete, the slide works. If you need to add qualifiers or explanations, the chain is broken and needs revision.
