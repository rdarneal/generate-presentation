# SCQA Micro-Narrative Slide Pattern

> **Note:** The `---` dividers in this file are documentation section boundaries. When generating presentation output, use `---` only as slide boundary markers per SKILL.md format rules.

## Pattern Overview

**Designation:** Pattern E (Layer 2 -- Slide-Level Pattern)
**Concept:** Compress the full SCQA (Situation-Complication-Question-Answer) narrative structure into a single slide to frame a point, introduce an argument, or set up a section.
**Inspired by:** Problem-framing narrative techniques widely used in management consulting, adapted from deck-level architecture to individual slide design.
**Best For:** Section openers, argument framing, executive summary slides, problem introductions, transition slides.

**When to Use:**
- Opening a new section or argument block within a deck
- Introducing a problem that the following slides will address
- Creating an executive summary slide that frames the entire deck
- Bridging between sections when the audience needs re-orientation
- Framing a recommendation that might face resistance (context earns credibility)

**When NOT to Use:**
- The audience already has full context and just needs the answer (use Pyramid Principle)
- The slide is deep in a support section where context was already established
- You need to present dense data or evidence (SCQA Micro is for framing, not evidence)
- The point is non-controversial and needs no setup (a simple action-title slide suffices)

---

## Core Philosophy

**Frame before you solve.**

Every argument is stronger when the audience first understands the context, then feels the tension, then has a question to answer. The SCQA Micro creates a complete narrative arc in a single slide -- moving from stability through disruption to resolution.

This pattern works because of a fundamental principle: people absorb answers better when they first feel the question. A recommendation delivered without context feels arbitrary. The same recommendation delivered after Situation, Complication, and Question feels inevitable.

**Contrast with Pyramid Principle (Pattern A):**
The Pyramid Principle leads with the conclusion. It works when the audience already has context and trusts the presenter. SCQA Micro works when the audience needs "why this matters" framing first.

```
PYRAMID (answer first)                    SCQA MICRO (frame first)
|- Audience has context                   |- Audience needs context
|- Presenter is trusted                   |- Presenter must earn credibility
|- Decision is expected                   |- Problem awareness is needed
|- Speed is paramount                     |- Buy-in is paramount
```

**When in doubt:** If your answer would prompt "why should I care?" use SCQA Micro. If they would nod and say "tell me more," use Pyramid.

**The power of the pattern:** SCQA Micro works because each element plays a specific psychological role. The Situation creates shared ground. The Complication creates tension. The Question channels that tension into a specific inquiry. The Answer resolves the inquiry with authority.

## Detailed Element Guide

### Situation (S) -- 1-2 sentences maximum

Establish stable, agreed-upon context. The audience should nod along.
- Use only facts the audience already knows or will immediately accept
- Ground with data when possible, but keep brief
- Should be non-controversial: if the audience would debate it, move it to Complication
- Shorter is better -- the Situation is setup, not the star

**Good:** "Our platform processes 2,400 enterprise transactions daily with 99.7% uptime." / "The North American SaaS market grew 18% in 2025, reaching $195B."
**Bad:** "Our platform is the market leader." (debatable) / "We have been underperforming for years." (this is a Complication)

### Complication (C) -- 1-2 sentences maximum

Introduce the tension -- what changed, what went wrong, or what threatens the stability.
- Must logically follow from the Situation ("but" or "however")
- Creates urgency, tension, or concern
- Quantify the stakes when possible ("$4.2M at risk" not "significant risk")
- Do not propose solutions -- let the tension sit
- The Complication is the engine of the pattern -- if it is weak, the whole slide is weak

**Good:** "However, three new entrants have captured 15% of our segment in the last 9 months, and our win rate has dropped from 68% to 41%."
**Bad:** "Things have gotten harder." (vague) / "We should probably look into this." (jumps to Answer)

### Question (Q) -- 1 sentence, phrased as a direct question

Articulate the key question that naturally arises from S + C.
- Must arise inevitably from S + C
- Can be explicit or implicit (embedded in the title or obvious from S+C)
- Use "How should we..." or "What is the best way to..." phrasing
- The Question channels the audience's thinking toward your Answer

**Good:** "How should we respond to protect our market share before Q4 renewals?"
**Bad:** "What should we do?" (too generic) / "Is this a problem?" (the Complication already established that)

### Answer (A) -- 1-2 sentences, specific and actionable

Deliver your recommendation. Must directly resolve the Question.
- Avoid hedging ("we might consider" or "one option could be")
- Often the most visually prominent element (bold, larger, highlighted)
- Quantify the expected outcome when possible
- The title should also state the Answer
- If the audience reads only the title and the Answer, they should get the full message

**Good:** "Acquire TargetCo by Q3 to close the feature gap and protect $18M in at-risk renewals."
**Bad:** "We need to do something about this." / "There are several options to consider."

---

## Implicit vs. Explicit Question

**Use explicit Q when:** The question is non-obvious or provocative; you want the audience to pause; there are multiple possible questions; the slide is a section opener; the audience is cross-functional and may not all see the same question.

**Use implicit Q (S-C-A) when:** The question is obvious from the Complication; space is limited; the audience is senior and will fill in the gap naturally; you are deep within a section where the overarching question was already established.

**In practice:** Executive audiences prefer the abbreviated S-C-A form because they can fill in the question themselves. Cross-functional or less-informed audiences benefit from the explicit question, which ensures everyone is asking the same thing before the Answer arrives.

## SCQA vs Pyramid Decision Guide

| Criterion | Use SCQA Micro | Use Pyramid |
|---|---|---|
| Audience context level | Low -- they need framing | High -- they already know the situation |
| Recommendation controversy | High -- context earns buy-in | Low -- they expect a recommendation |
| Slide position in deck | Section opener or executive summary | Evidence slide within a section |
| Presenter credibility | Still being established | Already established |
| Time pressure | Moderate -- worth 30 seconds of setup | High -- lead with the answer |

**Rule of thumb:** If you think the audience might ask "why should I care?" after hearing your answer, use SCQA Micro. If they would nod and say "tell me more," use Pyramid.

## Title Writing Guide

### Title Formulas

**Recommendation:** `[Action verb] [specific change] to [achieve quantified outcome]`
Example: "Acquire TargetCo to close the feature gap and protect $18M in renewals"

**Outcome-first:** `[Quantified outcome] [through/via] [recommended action]`
Example: "Margin improvement from 51% to 73% by shifting to enterprise focus"

### DO Examples

1. "We should acquire TargetCo to close the feature gap before Q4 renewals"
2. "Hiring 8 support engineers restores response times within 60 days"
3. "A three-part competitive defense protects $18M in at-risk revenue"
4. "Shifting to enterprise focus increases margins from 51% to 73%"

### DON'T Examples

1. "Market Situation" -- describes content, not conclusion
2. "The Challenge" -- labels the section, says nothing
3. "Our Recommendation" -- meta-description, not the recommendation itself
4. "Competitive Landscape" -- topic, not insight

## Compatibility Matrix

| Meta-Flow | Section | Compatibility | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SCQA** | Section openers within S, C, or Support | PRIMARY | Micro-SCQA frames each sub-argument with its own mini-narrative |
| **Challenger Sale** | Warm-up section | PRIMARY | Establishes shared understanding before the Reframe |
| **Three-Act Structure** | Act 1 Setup | PRIMARY | Establishes hero's world (S), inciting incident (C), dramatic question (Q) |
| **STAR** | Situation section | PRIMARY | Frames case study context with S+C+Q before the Task section |
| **5 Whys** | Problem Statement slide | PRIMARY | Frames initial problem before the Why cascade begins |
| **Any meta-flow** | Executive summary slide | PRIMARY | Single SCQA Micro at the start frames the entire presentation |

**Also ALTERNATIVE in:** Pyramid Principle (individual arguments needing context), WSWNW (context slide / section opener), Monroe Attention, AIDA Attention, PAS Problem.

## Before/After Examples

### Example 1: Strategy Argument

**BEFORE:**
```
Title: Enterprise Segment Recommendation
- We should shift focus to enterprise customers
- Enterprise has higher margins
- Our sales team has relevant experience
- The market window is open
```
**Problem:** Recommendation arrives without context. No sense of what problem it solves or what changed to make it urgent.

**AFTER:**
```
Title: Shifting to enterprise focus increases our
       gross margin from 51% to 73%

SITUATION
Our SMB segment has driven 80% of revenue for the
past 5 years with consistent 12% annual growth.

COMPLICATION
SMB acquisition costs have tripled since 2024, and
churn has risen from 15% to 33% -- eroding the unit
economics that made the segment viable.

ANSWER
Shift primary focus to enterprise customers, which
deliver 3x higher LTV, 73% gross margin, and 94%
retention -- restoring profitable growth.
```

### Example 2: Problem Introduction

**BEFORE:**
```
Title: Support Response Time Issue
- Response times are too slow
- Average response is now 14.3 hours
- Customers are complaining
- We need to hire more people
```

**AFTER:**
```
Title: Hiring 8 support engineers restores response
       times to SLA within 60 days

SITUATION
Our support team has maintained a 4.2-hour average
response time against a 6-hour SLA for 18 months.

COMPLICATION
Ticket volume doubled after the product expansion
in Q1 without additional headcount, pushing average
response times to 14.3 hours -- 2.4x above SLA.

QUESTION
What investment is needed to restore SLA compliance
before the Q3 renewal cycle?

ANSWER
Hire 8 support engineers ($640K annual cost) and
deploy AI triage to restore sub-6-hour response
within 60 days -- protecting $4.2M in Q3 renewals.
```

## Variations by Audience

| Audience | Situation | Complication | Answer | Preferred Layout |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Executive** | One short sentence (they know the context) | Financial impact and competitive urgency | Bold, quantified, specific -- the star of the slide | Answer-Dominant or Abbreviated S-C-A |
| **Technical** | Specific technical context (architecture, metrics) | Technical specifics (latency, failure rates, scale limits) | Technical approach, not just business outcome | Labeled Sections with detail |
| **Sales** | Describes customer's world, not yours | Customer's pain point, quantified in their terms | Value proposition, not internal recommendation | Narrative Flow for conversational tone |
| **Operations** | Current operational state with internal metrics | Process gaps, efficiency losses, capacity constraints | Specific actions, owners, timelines | Labeled Sections for clarity |

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Situation too long.** Burying the audience in background before the tension. Fix: limit to 1-2 sentences. If your S is longer than your A, you are over-contextualizing.
2. **Complication too weak.** Mild inconvenience instead of genuine disruption. Fix: quantify the stakes. Ask "Would this keep an executive up at night?"
3. **Question does not follow from S+C.** Feels like a non sequitur. Fix: read S, C, Q aloud as a paragraph; if Q does not feel inevitable, revise.
4. **Answer does not answer the Question.** Provides vague response or addresses a different question. Fix: map A directly back to Q using same terms.
5. **Controversial Situation.** Including debatable claims in S causes the audience to push back on the premise. Fix: move anything debatable to Complication.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Situation is 1-2 sentences of stable, non-controversial, data-grounded context
- [ ] Complication creates genuine tension with quantified stakes
- [ ] Complication logically follows from Situation ("but" or "however" test)
- [ ] Question (if explicit) arises inevitably from S + C
- [ ] Answer directly resolves the Question (explicit or implied)
- [ ] Answer is specific and actionable -- not vague or hedging
- [ ] Answer quantifies expected outcome when possible
- [ ] Title states the Answer or key insight as an action title
- [ ] Title is a complete sentence, not a topic label
- [ ] S-C-Q-A read aloud sounds like a natural paragraph
- [ ] Situation is shorter than or equal to the Answer (not over-contextualizing)

---

## Pro Tips

1. **Write C first.** The Complication is the engine of the entire slide. Start there, then build S around it, then derive Q and A. If you cannot write a sharp C, the audience may already have context, and a Pyramid slide would suffice.
2. **If your S is longer than your A, you are over-contextualizing.** The Answer should be the star of the slide. Trim S ruthlessly, strengthen A with specifics and quantification.
3. **Use SCQA Micro for the first slide of every new section.** This is the single highest-value use of the pattern. It re-orients the audience, frames what follows, and gives them a reason to pay attention.
4. **The title should make the rest of the slide optional.** An executive scanning the deck should get the full story from titles alone. If the title requires reading the body to make sense, rewrite it.
5. **Test the S-C connection aloud.** Read S followed by C with "but" or "however" between them. If it does not flow as a natural paragraph, the connection is broken and needs revision.
6. **Pair SCQA Micro with Pyramid for maximum impact.** SCQA Micro for the section opener (frames the argument and creates urgency), followed by Pyramid slides for supporting evidence (conclusion-first, data-backed). This combination is the gold standard for consulting decks.
