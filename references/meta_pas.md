# PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution) Presentation Template

> **Note:** The `---` dividers in this file are documentation section boundaries. When generating presentation output, use `---` only as slide boundary markers per SKILL.md format rules.

## Framework Overview
**Origin:** Copywriting community; widely used in persuasive communications
**Best For:** Sales presentations, persuasive pitches, marketing decks, landing page narratives
**Audience:** Prospects, budget holders, internal sponsors, anyone with a felt pain point
**Duration:** 5-14 slides (10-25 minutes typical)

## Core Philosophy
Name the pain. Make it impossible to ignore. Then offer the cure.

Unlike answer-first frameworks (Pyramid Principle) or teaching frameworks (Challenger Sale), PAS relies on emotional momentum: you surface a problem the audience already suspects, amplify it until inaction feels unacceptable, and then deliver your solution as the logical relief.

---

## Emotional Arc

**Trajectory:** Recognition (problem) -> Building pressure (agitate) -> Peak tension (end of agitate) -> Relief (solution) -> Resolve (CTA)

**Key transition:** The shift from Agitate to Solution is the sharpest turn in the deck -- move from maximum tension to immediate relief with no softening bridge.

---

## Slide Structure Template

### 1. TITLE SLIDE
**Elements:**
- Presentation title (hint at the pain or the transformation)
- Subtitle or tagline that signals relevance to the audience
- Date, presenter, company/logo

**Title Pattern:**
*"Why Your Pipeline Keeps Stalling -- And How to Fix It"*

---

### SECTION 1: PROBLEM (2-3 slides, ~20% of deck)

**Purpose:** Identify the specific pain point your audience faces. Establish that you understand their world and can name their struggle with precision.

**Content Requirements:**
- Name the problem in concrete, specific terms (not abstract)
- Use the audience's own language -- mirror how they describe the pain internally
- Ground it with a single compelling data point or anecdote
- Keep it focused: one core problem, not a laundry list

#### Slide 2: Problem Statement
**Title Pattern:** Direct statement of the pain, using the audience's language
*"Most sales teams lose 30% of qualified deals to 'no decision'"*
*"Manual reporting costs your finance team 15 hours every week"*

#### Slide 3: Problem Context (Optional -- use when audience may not realize problem severity)
**Title Pattern:** Adds scope or dimension to the problem
*"This problem affects 78% of mid-market SaaS companies"*
*"The gap between top and bottom performers is widening"*

**Content:**
- Industry context or benchmarks that validate the problem
- Why this problem exists now (market shift, technology change, competitive pressure)

---

### SECTION 2: AGITATE (3-5 slides, ~40% of deck)

**Purpose:** Amplify the consequences of the problem. Transform intellectual awareness into emotional urgency. Quantify the cost of inaction. Make the status quo feel untenable.

**Content Requirements:**
- Explore multiple dimensions of the problem's impact (financial, operational, emotional, competitive)
- Quantify costs wherever possible -- translate pain into dollars, hours, or risk percentages
- Show cascading consequences: how the problem compounds over time
- Include at least one emotional or human-impact element
- End this section at peak tension, right before introducing the solution
- Never agitate a problem you cannot solve

**Critical Guardrail:** Amplify consequences without being manipulative. Use real data, honest projections, and genuine stakes.

#### Slide 4: Financial Impact
**Title Pattern:** Quantified cost statement
*"No-decision deals cost the average sales team $2.3M in lost annual revenue"*
*"Manual processes are burning $400K per year in senior talent time"*

#### Slide 5: Cascading Consequences
**Title Pattern:** How the problem compounds or spreads
*"Stalled deals create a vicious cycle that erodes team morale and forecast accuracy"*
*"Every month of delay widens the gap between you and early adopters"*

#### Slide 6: Competitive or Market Pressure
**Title Pattern:** External forces making inaction riskier
*"Competitors who solved this are growing 2x faster"*
*"The market is shifting -- companies that wait will face 3x the migration cost"*

#### Slide 7: Human / Emotional Impact (Optional -- use for audiences that value team welfare or culture)
**Title Pattern:** The personal or team-level toll
*"Your top performers are exhausted by workarounds -- and recruiters are calling"*
*"Customer trust erodes with every delayed response"*

#### Slide 8: Cost of Inaction Summary (Optional -- use when Agitate spans 4+ slides)
**Title Pattern:** Synthesizes all consequences into a single stark picture
*"Doing nothing costs $2.3M in revenue, 15 hours/week in productivity, and your best people"*

---

### SECTION 3: SOLUTION (3-5 slides, ~30% of deck)

**Purpose:** Present your offering as the direct answer to every dimension of pain you just established. Map your solution explicitly to the problems and consequences from Sections 1 and 2.

**Content Requirements:**
- Introduce the solution with a clear, high-level value statement
- Map each key capability back to a specific pain from the Agitate section
- Include proof points: data, case studies, testimonials, or demonstrations
- Quantify the positive outcome (mirror the cost-of-inaction numbers with value-of-action numbers)
- Every major pain raised in Problem and Agitate must be addressed

#### Slide 9: Solution Overview
**Title Pattern:** High-level value proposition tied to the core problem
*"[Product] eliminates no-decision deals by giving reps the tools to build consensus"*
*"Automate your reporting pipeline and reclaim 15 hours per week"*

#### Slides 10-11: Key Capabilities (FAB Pattern)
**Title Pattern:** Specific capability stated as a benefit
*"Stakeholder mapping surfaces hidden blockers before deals stall"*
*"Automated dashboards replace 15 hours of manual Excel work"*

**Note:** One slide per major capability. Limit to 2-3 capabilities. Each should reference a pain from the Agitate section.

#### Slide 12: Proof Points
**Title Pattern:** Evidence that the solution delivers results
*"Company X recovered $1.8M in pipeline within 90 days"*
*"Teams using [Product] report 40% fewer stalled deals"*

---

### SECTION 4: CALL TO ACTION (1 slide, ~10% of deck)

**Purpose:** Convert the audience's urgency into a specific next step. The CTA should feel like the natural, obvious move after everything they have just seen.

**Content Requirements:**
- One clear, specific ask (not a menu of options)
- Low-friction first step (pilot, demo, workshop -- not "sign a 3-year contract")
- Urgency tie-back: reference the cost of delay from the Agitate section
- Proportional to relationship stage (early = low-commitment, late = higher-commitment)

#### Slide 13: Call to Action
**Title Pattern:** Direct statement of what you want them to do
*"Start a 30-day pilot and see results within the first week"*
*"Let's schedule a 45-minute workshop to map your pipeline gaps"*

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing a PAS deck:

**Problem Section:**
- [ ] Problem is specific, not generic ("your pipeline stalls at the consensus stage" vs. "sales is hard")
- [ ] Problem is stated in the audience's language, not your product's terminology
- [ ] Audience would nod in recognition -- you named their reality accurately
- [ ] Problem is scoped to something your solution actually addresses

**Agitate Section:**
- [ ] At least 2 distinct dimensions of impact are explored (financial, operational, competitive, emotional)
- [ ] Costs are quantified with real or defensible numbers
- [ ] Cascading consequences are shown (not just first-order effects)
- [ ] Tone is honest and evidence-based, not manipulative or fear-mongering
- [ ] Section ends at peak tension, right before the Solution

**Solution Section:**
- [ ] Every major pain raised in Agitate is explicitly addressed
- [ ] Solution is introduced at the level of value delivered, not features listed
- [ ] At least one proof point with quantified results is included
- [ ] Capabilities are mapped back to specific pains using FAB structure
- [ ] No pain was agitated that the solution cannot address

**Call to Action:**
- [ ] CTA is a single, clear next step (not "let us know if you're interested")
- [ ] Ask is proportional to relationship stage
- [ ] Urgency is tied back to Agitate section costs, not artificial deadlines

**Titles:**
- [ ] Problem titles name the pain in the audience's own words
- [ ] Agitate titles always include a number (cost, time, percentage)
- [ ] Solution titles directly reference a pain from the Agitate section
- [ ] Slide titles alone tell the complete story

**Overall Deck:**
- [ ] Emotional arc flows: recognition -> pressure -> relief -> resolve
- [ ] Deck is 9-14 slides (not bloated beyond PAS's compact power)
- [ ] No section is disproportionate (Problem ~20%, Agitate ~40%, Solution ~30%, CTA ~10%)

## Common Patterns by Use Case

### SaaS Sales Pitch
1. **Problem:** Current tool/process creates a specific operational bottleneck
2. **Agitate:** Quantify wasted time, revenue at risk, competitive disadvantage, team frustration
3. **Solution:** Your platform eliminates the bottleneck; FAB for 2-3 key features; customer case study
4. **CTA:** Free trial, guided demo, or pilot program

### Internal Budget Request
1. **Problem:** Current process or system creates a measurable drag on the team
2. **Agitate:** Cost to the organization in budget terms (wasted FTE hours, error rates, opportunity cost); compare to peer organizations
3. **Solution:** Proposed investment and expected ROI; implementation plan; risk mitigation
4. **CTA:** Approve budget for Phase 1; decision timeline

### Vendor Replacement Pitch
1. **Problem:** Current vendor creates a specific, quantifiable pain
2. **Agitate:** Switching costs of staying (not just switching costs of leaving); reliability issues compounding; hidden costs surfacing; competitive risk
3. **Solution:** Your offering as the upgrade path; migration plan that de-risks the switch; proof from similar migrations
4. **CTA:** Migration assessment or parallel pilot

## Adaptation Notes

**Shorter Decks (5-8 slides):**
- Compress Problem to 1 slide
- Compress Agitate to 2 slides (combine financial + cascading consequences)
- Solution: 1-2 slides (overview + one proof point)
- CTA: 1 slide

**Extended Decks (13-15 slides):**
- Expand Agitate with additional dimensions (regulatory risk, brand reputation)
- Add 1-2 proof points in Solution
- Add a "How It Works" or differentiation slide
- Maximum 15 slides; move ROI calculations and technical details to appendix

**For Analytical Audiences (CFOs, Engineers):**
- Lean into quantification in Agitate -- show your math, cite sources
- Add ROI calculations and payback period in Solution
- Make the CTA data-driven

**For Executive Audiences (C-Suite, Board):**
- Sharpen Problem to strategic-level framing (market position, competitive threat)
- In Agitate, emphasize competitive and shareholder impact over operational details
- CTA should be a decision request, not an exploration invitation

## Template Usage Example

**Topic:** "SaaS platform pitch to VP of Sales whose team struggles with deal velocity"

**PAS Structure:**

- **Problem:** Deals are stalling at the multi-stakeholder consensus stage
  - Slide 2: "68% of your qualified pipeline stalls when 3+ stakeholders get involved"
  - Slide 3: "This isn't a rep skill problem -- it's a visibility problem"

- **Agitate:** The cost of stalled deals and the compounding damage
  - Slide 4: "No-decision deals cost your team $2.3M in annual pipeline leakage"
  - Slide 5: "Stalled deals poison your forecast -- last quarter's accuracy was 41%"
  - Slide 6: "Your competitors using deal intelligence tools are closing 35% more pipeline"
  - Slide 7: "Your best AEs are demoralized -- they're working harder but closing less"

- **Solution:** Deal intelligence platform that maps stakeholders and surfaces blockers
  - Slide 8: "[Product] gives every rep a real-time map of deal health and stakeholder alignment"
  - Slide 9: "AI-powered risk scoring flags stalling deals 3 weeks before they go dark"
  - Slide 10: "Automated next-step recommendations turn data into rep action"
  - Slide 11: "Acme Corp recovered $1.8M in stalled pipeline within 90 days of deployment"

- **Call to Action:**
  - Slide 12: "Start a 30-day pilot with your top 5 reps and measure the impact on Q3 pipeline"

**Slide Count:** 12 slides (1 title + 2 Problem + 4 Agitate + 4 Solution + 1 CTA)

**Pattern Mapping:**
| Section | Slides | Slide-Level Pattern Used |
|---------|--------|--------------------------|
| Title | 1 | -- |
| Problem | 2-3 | Problem-Solution-Benefit (Problem portion), SCQA Micro-Narrative |
| Agitate | 4-7 | What-So What-Now What (data + implications), Monroe's Visualization (consequences) |
| Solution | 8-10 | FAB (for each key capability) |
| Proof | 11 | BAB Mini-Story or STAR Micro-Case |
| CTA | 12 | Direct action slide |

---

## Compatible Slide Patterns

| PAS Section | Primary Pattern | Alternative Pattern | Why |
|-------------|----------------|--------------------|----|
| **Problem** | Problem-Solution-Benefit (Problem portion) | SCQA Micro-Narrative | PSB's problem framing is concise and direct |
| **Agitate** | What-So What-Now What | Monroe's Visualization | Pairs data with interpretation for quantifying consequences |
| **Solution** | FAB (Feature-Advantage-Benefit) | BAB Mini-Story | Translates capabilities into value; BAB shows transformation |
| **Proof** | STAR Micro-Case | BAB Mini-Story | Compressed proof in Situation-Task-Action-Result format |
| **CTA** | Pyramid Principle | -- | States conclusion ("do this next") with supporting logistics |

## Final Pro Tips

1. **Write the Agitate section first.** It is the engine of the deck. If you cannot articulate 3-4 compelling consequences, PAS may be the wrong framework.

2. **Mirror their language, not yours.** If they say "our pipeline is leaky," do not rewrite it as "suboptimal conversion rates." Precision in language builds instant trust.

3. **Quantify relentlessly in Agitate.** "It's costing you time" is weak. "It's costing you 780 hours and $400K per year" is undeniable.

4. **Agitate-to-Solution should feel like relief, not a pitch.** If it feels like a sales pivot, the Agitate section needs more tension.

5. **Never agitate a problem you cannot solve.** Every pain in Agitate must map to a capability in Solution. Raising unaddressable consequences damages credibility.

6. **Calibrate intensity to your relationship.** First meeting: data-driven, peer-benchmarked. Deep relationship: more direct about their specific struggles.

7. **The CTA should feel inevitable.** If Problem, Agitate, and Solution are doing their job, the audience should already be thinking "how do we start?" before you reach the CTA.
