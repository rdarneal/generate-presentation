# AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action) Presentation Template

> **Note:** The `---` dividers in this file are documentation section boundaries. When generating presentation output, use `---` only as slide boundary markers per SKILL.md format rules.

## Framework Overview
**Origin:** E. St. Elmo Lewis, classic marketing model for moving people through a purchase funnel
**Best For:** Product launches, investor pitches, marketing campaign decks, partner pitches
**Audience:** Prospects, investors, partners, marketing stakeholders
**Duration:** 5-15 slides (10-30 minutes typical)

## Core Philosophy
Hook them, show them, make them want it, tell them what to do next. Unlike consulting frameworks that lead with the answer, AIDA deliberately builds momentum toward a climactic call-to-action.

## Slide Structure Template

### 1. TITLE SLIDE
**Elements:**
- Product/company/campaign name
- Tagline or value proposition (one line)
- Date, presenter, company branding

**Example Title:**
*"Introducing Relay: The Collaboration Platform That Eliminates Meeting Overload"*

---

### 2. ATTENTION — Hook Slide (1-2 slides, ~10% of deck)
**Purpose:** Immediately disrupt the audience's default mindset. Create a moment of surprise, curiosity, or emotional resonance that earns permission for the rest of the deck.
**Content Requirements:**
- ONE bold, singular hook — do not dilute with multiple messages
- Choose one hook type: startling statistic, provocative question, vivid scenario, or short story
- The hook must connect directly to the problem your product solves
- No product mention yet — this slide is about the audience's world
- Hook must be verifiable — never fabricate statistics
- Be specific to the domain — avoid generic hooks ("The world is changing fast")

**Slide Title Pattern:** Statement that surprises or provokes
*"Teams lose 31 hours per month to unnecessary meetings — and most don't even realize it"*
*"What if your best employees are quitting because of your calendar, not your culture?"*

**Typical Structure:**
```
HOOK
[Bold statistic, question, or story — large, visual, impossible to ignore]

CONTEXT (optional, 1-2 lines)
[Brief framing that grounds the hook in the audience's reality]
```

---

### 3-7. INTEREST — Features & Capabilities (3-6 slides, ~40% of deck)
**Purpose:** Build intellectual engagement by showing how your product or solution works, what it does, and how it differs from alternatives. This is the rational core of the presentation — move from "that's a big problem" to "this is a credible, compelling solution."

**Content Requirements:**
- Product overview or "how it works" slide (1 slide)
- Key capabilities, each framed as Feature-Advantage-Benefit (2-4 slides)
- Differentiation or competitive positioning (1-2 slides)
- Optional: demo flow, architecture diagram, or product walkthrough

**Slide Title Pattern:** Capability statements that imply advantage
*"Real-time async updates replace 80% of status meetings"*
*"AI-powered agenda builder cuts meeting prep from 30 minutes to 30 seconds"*

#### Interest Slide 1: Product Overview / How It Works

**Title:** Clear statement of what the product does
*"Relay replaces unnecessary meetings with structured async collaboration"*

**Content:**
- 1-2 sentence product description
- Visual: product screenshot, architecture diagram, or simple "how it works" flow
- Position the product category (what it replaces or complements)

#### Interest Slides 2-4: Key Capabilities (FAB Pattern)

**Title:** Advantage or benefit statement for each capability
*"Smart scheduling finds optimal meeting windows across 5 time zones in seconds"*

**Content per slide:**
- Feature: What the capability is (technical or functional description)
- Advantage: Why it is better than the alternative or status quo
- Benefit: What the customer gains (quantified outcome where possible)

**Visual Priority:** Product screenshot or demo visual > diagram > bullets. If using text, max 4-5 bullets.

#### Interest Slide 5: Differentiation / Competitive Positioning

**Title:** Statement of unique position
*"Relay is the only platform that combines async-first design with real-time fallback"*

**Content:**
- Competitive comparison (2x2 matrix, feature checklist, or positioning map)
- Highlight 2-3 unique differentiators
- Avoid naming competitors directly if presenting to investors (use categories instead)

---

### 8-11. DESIRE — Benefits, Proof & Emotional Connection (2-4 slides, ~30% of deck)
**Purpose:** Shift the audience from "this is interesting" to "I want this." Desire is built through proof that the product delivers real results and through emotional resonance that makes the audience see themselves succeeding with it.

**Content Requirements:**
- Customer success story or case study (1-2 slides)
- Social proof: testimonials, logos, metrics (1 slide)
- ROI or business impact quantification (1 slide)
- Optional: emotional or aspirational vision slide

**Slide Title Pattern:** Outcome-focused statements with proof
*"Acme Corp reduced meeting hours by 62% in the first 90 days"*
*"Over 500 teams trust Relay to reclaim their productive time"*

#### Desire Slide 1-2: Customer Success / Case Study

**Title:** Specific, quantified customer outcome
*"Global retailer cut weekly meetings from 23 to 8 — saving $1.2M annually in productivity"*

**Content:**
- Brief customer context (who they are, what they faced)
- What changed after adopting your solution
- Quantified results (before/after metrics)
- Optional: direct customer quote

**Typical Structure (BAB Mini-Story):**
```
BEFORE
[Customer pain — specific, relatable]
• Pain point 1
• Pain point 2

AFTER
[Quantified outcomes]
• Result 1 (with number)
• Result 2 (with number)

BRIDGE
[How your solution made this possible — 1-2 sentences]
```

#### Desire Slide 3: Social Proof

**Title:** Breadth of adoption or trust statement
*"Trusted by 500+ teams from startups to the Fortune 100"*

**Content:**
- Customer logos (6-12, recognizable brands)
- Key metrics: number of users, teams, or companies
- Industry or segment diversity
- Awards, certifications, or analyst recognition (if applicable)

#### Desire Slide 4: ROI / Business Impact

**Title:** Financial or strategic impact statement
*"Average customer achieves 340% ROI within 6 months"*

**Content:**
- ROI calculation or payback period
- Time-to-value metrics
- Comparison: cost of solution vs. cost of problem (from Attention hook)
- Tie back to the original hook statistic for narrative closure

---

### 12-13. ACTION — Call-to-Action with Urgency (1-2 slides, ~10% of deck)
**Purpose:** Convert audience momentum into a specific next step. The CTA must be clear, concrete, and time-bound. Remove ambiguity about what happens next.

**Content Requirements:**
- One primary CTA (not three options — one clear ask)
- Urgency driver: time-limited offer, competitive pressure, or opportunity cost
- Logistics: how to take the next step (link, contact, meeting)
- Optional: incentive or risk reversal (free trial, money-back guarantee)

**Slide Title Pattern:** Direct action statement with urgency
*"Start your free pilot this month — before Q3 planning locks your budget"*
*"Let's schedule a 30-minute demo to see Relay in your environment"*

#### Action Slide 1: Primary CTA

**Title:** Clear call-to-action with urgency element
*"Start your free 30-day pilot — implementation takes less than a day"*

**Content:**
- The specific ask (what you want them to do)
- Why now (urgency — time-limited, competitive window, budget cycle)
- How (logistics — URL, QR code, contact info, next meeting)
- Risk reversal (free trial, no commitment, guarantee)

**Typical Structure:**
```
THE ASK
[One clear, specific action]

WHY NOW
[Urgency driver — deadline, opportunity cost, competitive pressure]

NEXT STEP
[Exact logistics — URL, email, meeting scheduling link]

[Optional: GUARANTEE or RISK REVERSAL]
```

#### Action Slide 2 (Optional): Contact / Next Steps Detail

**Title:** *"Here's what happens next"*

**Content:**
- Step-by-step onboarding or engagement process
- Timeline expectations
- Key contacts and resources
- Reinforce the primary benefit one final time

---

## Slide Title Guidelines

### DO: Use Action Titles
- "Teams lose 31 hours per month to unnecessary meetings"
- "Acme Corp saved $1.2M in the first year by switching to Relay"
- "Start your free pilot this month before Q3 budget locks"

### DON'T: Use Topic Titles
- "The Problem"
- "Product Features"
- "Pricing and Next Steps"

**Rule:** Every title should state the "so what" — the conclusion, insight, or action — not describe the category of content on the slide. A reader skimming only the titles should understand the full persuasive arc.

---

## Adaptation Notes

**For Shorter Decks (7-10 slides):**
- Attention: 1 slide (combine hook + brief context)
- Interest: 3-4 slides (product overview + 2-3 top capabilities)
- Desire: 1-2 slides (one case study + social proof combined)
- Action: 1 slide (CTA with urgency)

**For Extended Decks (13-15 slides):**
- Attention: 1-2 slides
- Interest: 5-6 slides (deeper product walkthrough, competitive landscape)
- Desire: 3-4 slides (case study, social proof, ROI)
- Action: 2 slides (CTA + next steps)
- Maximum 15 slides; move additional detail to appendix

**No minimum:** For clear, simple pitches, 1-3 slides is perfectly fine.

**For Investor Audiences:**
- Heavier Interest section: include business model, unit economics, competitive moat
- Desire section emphasizes traction metrics over individual testimonials
- Action section states round size, use of funds, and timeline
- Add team slide in Interest or Desire section

**For Technical Audiences:**
- Interest section goes deeper: architecture, integrations, security, scalability
- Desire section includes technical case studies and implementation timelines
- Reduce emotional language; increase specificity and data density
- CTA may be "schedule a technical deep-dive" rather than "buy now"

**For Internal Stakeholders:**
- Attention hook focuses on internal metrics or strategic alignment
- Interest section emphasizes feasibility and resource requirements
- Desire section shows cross-functional benefits and risk mitigation
- Action is a decision request with clear approval criteria

## Compatible Slide Patterns

| AIDA Section | Primary Slide Pattern | Alternative Pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|

| **Interest** | FAB (Feature-Advantage-Benefit) | Problem-Solution-Benefit | One FAB slide per key capability |
| **Interest** (overview) | Problem-Solution-Benefit | Pyramid Principle | For the "how it works" overview slide |
| **Interest** (differentiation) | Pyramid Principle (action title + evidence) | MECE Decomposition | For competitive positioning |
| **Desire** (case studies) | BAB Mini-Story | STAR Micro-Case | Quantified before/after is essential |

## Final Pro Tips

1. **Nail the hook or lose the room.** If the Attention slide doesn't land, nothing else matters. Test it on people who don't know your product.
2. **Features bore; benefits sell.** Never present a feature without its customer benefit. If you catch yourself listing specs, stop and translate to FAB.
3. **Desire needs proof, not promises.** Every Desire slide needs a number, a name, or a quote from a real customer.
4. **One CTA, not a menu.** Multiple options create decision paralysis. Present ONE clear next step.
5. **Tie the end to the beginning.** Your ROI or CTA should reference the Attention hook for narrative closure.
6. **Calibrate urgency honestly.** Manufactured urgency erodes trust. Use genuine urgency: budget cycles, competitive timing, opportunity cost.
7. **Test with titles only.** Do the titles alone tell a complete persuasive story from hook to CTA? If not, rewrite them.
