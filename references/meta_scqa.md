# SCQA (Situation-Complication-Question-Answer) Presentation Template

> **Note:** The `---` dividers in this file are documentation section boundaries. When generating presentation output, use `---` only as slide boundary markers per SKILL.md format rules.

## Framework Overview
**Inspired by:** Problem-framing narrative techniques widely used in management consulting and strategic communication
**Best For:** Strategy decks, consulting recommendations, executive briefings, problem framing
**Audience:** C-suite, senior leaders, cross-functional stakeholders needing alignment
**Duration:** 5-15 slides (10-30 minutes typical)

## Core Philosophy
Set the stage before delivering the answer. Build shared understanding of reality, introduce tension, then resolve it with a clear recommendation supported by structured evidence.

**Key Relationship:** SCQA is often the *opening framework* that feeds into Pyramid Principle for the *body* of the deck. The SCQ section sets context, and the Answer becomes the top of the pyramid, with the Support section following Pyramid structure.

## Slide Structure Template

### 1. TITLE SLIDE
**Elements:**
- Project/Topic name
- Subtitle framing the strategic question or context (optional)
- Date, presenter, confidentiality marking

**Title Pattern:**
*"Digital Transformation Strategy: Addressing the Widening Technology Gap"*

---

### 2-3. SITUATION (1-2 slides)
**Purpose:** Establish agreed-upon facts and context that the audience already knows or will readily accept.

**Content Requirements:**
- Stable, uncontroversial facts about the current state (if it would provoke debate, move to Complication)
- Relevant market, industry, or organizational context
- Key metrics or baseline performance data
- Keep brief: maximum 2 slides

**Title Pattern:** Factual statements describing the current state
*"Our core business has delivered steady 8% annual growth over the past five years"*
*"The enterprise software market reached $650B in 2025 with 12% CAGR"*

**Typical Structure:**
```
CURRENT STATE
[2-3 factual statements about the baseline]

KEY CONTEXT
• [Market/industry fact]
• [Organizational fact]
• [Performance baseline with data]
```

---

### 4-6. COMPLICATION (1-3 slides)
**Purpose:** Introduce the tension — what changed, what went wrong, what threatens the stability described in the Situation.

**Content Requirements:**
- Clear statement of what changed or what is at risk
- Quantified impact of the disruption or threat
- Evidence that the status quo is no longer viable
- Build tension progressively if using multiple slides
- Do not propose solutions here

**Title Pattern:** Action statements describing the disruption or threat
*"New market entrants have eroded our pricing power by 23% in 18 months"*
*"Customer acquisition costs have tripled while conversion rates declined 40%"*

**Typical Structure:**
```
WHAT CHANGED
[Clear statement of the disruption]

IMPACT
• [Quantified consequence 1]
• [Quantified consequence 2]
• [Quantified consequence 3]

IMPLICATION
[Why this demands a response]
```

---

### 7. QUESTION (1 slide or implicit)
**Purpose:** Articulate the key question that logically arises from the Situation and Complication.

**Content Requirements:**
- One clear, specific question the presentation will answer
- Optional: 2-3 sub-questions that structure the analysis
- The question must arise inevitably from S + C — if it doesn't, the framing is off
- Can be omitted if the Complication makes the question obvious

**Title Pattern:** The question itself, stated directly
*"How should we respond to protect market share and reignite growth?"*
*"Should we build, buy, or partner to close the capability gap?"*

---

### 8. ANSWER (1 slide)
**Purpose:** State your high-level recommendation. Everything after this slide exists to support it.

**Content Requirements:**
- 1-2 sentence bottom-line recommendation (be decisive — no hedging)
- 2-4 key supporting reasons (these become the Support section pillars)
- Expected impact/outcome (quantified if possible)
- The Answer must directly resolve the Question

**Title Pattern:** Action-oriented statement of the recommendation
*"We recommend acquiring TechCo to close the AI capability gap and protect $200M in revenue"*
*"Launching a three-pronged digital transformation will restore competitive parity within 18 months"*

**Typical Structure:**
```
RECOMMENDATION
[Clear, decisive statement of what to do]

KEY REASONS
1. [Supporting argument 1 — previews Support section pillar]
2. [Supporting argument 2]
3. [Supporting argument 3]

EXPECTED IMPACT
[Quantified outcome: revenue, cost, timeline, risk reduction]
```

---

### SUPPORT (bulk of deck, 3-8 slides)
**Purpose:** Provide the evidence, analysis, and reasoning that backs up the Answer. Follows Pyramid Principle structure — each argument pillar gets its own sub-section.

**Content Requirements per Pillar:**
- Header slide stating the argument as a conclusion
- 1-2 evidence slides with data, analysis, or case examples
- Each evidence slide should independently support its argument
- Arguments must be MECE: mutually exclusive (no overlap) and collectively exhaustive (no gaps)
- Every slide title must be an action title stating a conclusion

#### SUPPORT PILLAR 1

**Pillar 1 Header Title:**
*"The AI market opportunity is $8B and growing 25% annually in our segment"*

**Pillar 1 Evidence (1-2 slides):**
*"TAM analysis shows $8B addressable market with 67% in enterprise segment"*
*"Three competitor acquisitions in 12 months signal market consolidation"*

#### SUPPORT PILLAR 2

**Pillar 2 Header Title:**
*"TechCo's platform is the strongest acquisition target based on technology, team, and valuation"*

**Pillar 2 Evidence (1-2 slides):**
Similar pattern to Pillar 1 evidence slides

#### SUPPORT PILLAR 3 (Optional)

---

### CLOSING SECTION

#### N-1. NEXT STEPS / IMPLEMENTATION (1-2 slides)

**Implementation Roadmap:**
*"Three-phase implementation plan delivers first results within 90 days"*
- Phased timeline with milestones
- Resource requirements and ownership
- Quick wins identified for early momentum

**Decision Request / Call to Action:**
*"Seeking board approval to proceed with Phase 1 due diligence by March 15"*
- Specific asks or decisions needed
- Decision timeline and urgency

---

## APPENDIX (Optional, not presented)
- Detailed methodology and assumptions
- Additional data cuts and sensitivity analysis
- Risk scenarios and mitigation plans
- Rejected alternatives and rationale

---

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing:

**SCQA Logic Flow:**
- [ ] Situation contains only agreed-upon, non-controversial facts
- [ ] Complication introduces genuine tension that disrupts the Situation
- [ ] Question arises naturally from Situation + Complication (feels inevitable)
- [ ] Answer directly resolves the Question
- [ ] Support section arguments are MECE and directly back the Answer
- [ ] The S-C-Q-A sequence reads as a coherent narrative

**Narrative Integrity:**
- [ ] Audience would nod along through Situation (nothing surprising)
- [ ] Audience feels concern or urgency during Complication
- [ ] Answer provides relief and direction
- [ ] No logical gaps between any two adjacent sections

**MECE (Support Section):**
- [ ] Main arguments do not overlap conceptually
- [ ] Main arguments cover the complete reasoning
- [ ] Audience would not ask "but what about X?" after seeing all pillars

**Clarity:**
- [ ] Every slide title is a self-contained conclusion
- [ ] A reader could follow the main argument from titles alone
- [ ] Data visualizations are clear with labeled axes and sources
- [ ] Quantification replaces vague language ("43%" not "significant")

**Executive Readiness:**
- [ ] Deck can stand alone without verbal presentation
- [ ] Main recommendation is evident by the Answer slide
- [ ] Supporting detail is accessible but not required for the core message
- [ ] Next steps are concrete, time-bound, and assigned

## Multi-Thread Adaptation

When the input contains multiple parallel threads (e.g., 7 initiatives benchmarked against industry standards), adapt the SCQA structure to maintain thread coherence. See SKILL.md "Multi-Thread Management" for strategy definitions.

**Thread-per-Pillar SCQA (2-5 threads):**

| Section | Single-Thread (standard) | Multi-Thread Adaptation |
|---|---|---|
| **Situation** | Shared context about the landscape | Shared context + brief current-state snapshot of each thread |
| **Complication** | Single disruption or tension | Overview of gaps/risks across ALL threads (summary slide), then optional 1 slide showing the pattern or common theme |
| **Question** | One strategic question | "How should we prioritize and address these [N] gaps?" |
| **Answer** | One recommendation | Prioritized ranking of all threads with rationale for ordering |
| **Support** | 2-3 MECE argument pillars | Each pillar = one thread (or priority tier). Within each pillar, show that thread's specific situation, complication, and resolution |
| **Next Steps** | Consolidated implementation | Consolidated across all threads, grouped by timeline |

**Tiered Grouping SCQA (6+ threads):**

Use Tiered Grouping (Strategy B) when thread count exceeds 5. Rank threads by impact/urgency, give Tier 1 (top 2-3) full pillar treatment, and cover Tier 2 threads via summary matrix slides.

**Example — 7 Initiatives Benchmarked Against Industry Standards:**

- **Situation (1 slide):** "Our organization operates across 7 capability areas; industry benchmarks have shifted significantly in the past 18 months"
  - Matrix: 7 initiatives x current state summary
- **Complication (1-2 slides):** "Five of seven capability areas now fall below industry median, with three in the bottom quartile"
  - Gap matrix: 7 initiatives x gap severity, ranked
- **Question (1 slide):** "Which capability gaps should we close first, and what investment is required?"
- **Answer (1 slide):** "Prioritize Initiatives C, A, and F based on business impact and feasibility — projected to close 80% of the gap within 12 months"
  - Tier 1: C, A, F (full treatment in Support)
  - Tier 2: B, D, G, E (summary treatment)
- **Support — Tier 1 pillars (2 slides each = 6 slides):**
  - Pillar: Initiative C — current state vs benchmark, root cause of gap, recommended action, expected impact
  - Pillar: Initiative A — same structure
  - Pillar: Initiative F — same structure
- **Support — Tier 2 summary (1 slide):**
  - Matrix: B, D, G, E with gap, recommended action, timeline, estimated cost
- **Next Steps (1 slide):** Consolidated roadmap across all 7, with Phase 1 (Tier 1) and Phase 2 (Tier 2)

**Slide Count:** 14 slides (within 15-slide ceiling)

**Multi-Thread Quality Check:**
- [ ] Every initiative from the input appears in the Complication gap assessment
- [ ] Every initiative appears in the Answer (even if deprioritized)
- [ ] Tier 1 initiatives each have a complete S-C-resolution arc within their Support pillar
- [ ] Tier 2 initiatives are present in the summary slide (not silently dropped)
- [ ] A reader can trace any single initiative from Situation through Next Steps

## Template Usage Example

**Topic:** "Should we enter the Southeast Asian market for our B2B payments platform?"

**SCQA Structure:**

**Situation:**
- Our B2B payments platform processes $45B annually across 12 markets in North America and Europe
- We have achieved 28% market share in our core segments with 94% customer retention

**Complication:**
- Southeast Asian B2B payments are growing at 35% CAGR (vs 8% in our current markets)
- Three competitors have announced SEA expansion in the past 6 months
- Our top 5 multinational customers are requesting SEA payment capabilities
- Failing to act risks $120M in at-risk revenue from customers seeking single-platform providers

**Question:**
- Should we enter the Southeast Asian B2B payments market, and if so, what is the right entry strategy?

**Answer:**
- Enter SEA via partnership with RegionalPay to launch in Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand within 12 months, targeting $80M in incremental revenue by Year 3

**Support Pillars:**
- **Pillar 1:** SEA B2B payments market is highly attractive — $180B TAM growing at 35% with fragmented competition
  - Evidence: Market sizing by segment; competitive landscape; regulatory tailwinds
- **Pillar 2:** Partnership with RegionalPay is the fastest, lowest-risk entry path
  - Evidence: Build (24+ months) vs partnership (8 months); RegionalPay has licenses in 6 markets; $15M vs $60M+ cost
- **Pillar 3:** Customer demand and retention risk justify the investment
  - Evidence: 5 top customers ($120M ARR) formally requested SEA; 3 recent losses citing coverage gaps

**Slide Count:** 13 slides (Title: 1, Situation: 1, Complication: 2, Answer: 1, Pillar 1: 2, Pillar 2: 2, Pillar 3: 2, Next Steps: 2)

## Compatible Slide Patterns

| SCQA Section | Primary Pattern | Alternative Pattern | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Situation** | SCQA Micro-Narrative (E) | Pyramid Principle (A) | Structured context framing |
| **Complication** | What-So What-Now What (B) | MECE Decomposition (D) | Data with interpretation; MECE for multi-dimensional complications |
| **Question** | Single statement | -- | Bold question as title; sub-questions as body |
| **Answer** | Pyramid Principle (A) | -- | Conclusion-first with supporting reasons |
| **Support** | Pyramid Principle (A) | WSWNW (B), BAB (F), STAR (I) | Action titles throughout; mix patterns by content type |
| **Next Steps** | Problem-Solution-Benefit (J) | Pyramid Principle (A) | Each initiative framed with rationale |

---

## Final Pro Tips

1. **Test the SCQ narrative aloud.** Read S, C, and Q as a single paragraph. If it doesn't flow as "We are here... but this happened... so the question is...", the framing needs work.

2. **The Complication is your leverage.** The deck's strength depends on how well the Complication creates urgency. Quantify the cost of inaction.

3. **Make the Question feel inevitable.** If the audience would ask a different question after your S and C, the framing is misaligned.

4. **Keep Situation non-controversial.** If anything would provoke debate, move it to Complication. Situation is "head-nodding" territory.

5. **Transition cleanly from Answer to Support.** The key reasons in your Answer slide should map 1:1 to your Support pillars.

6. **Use SCQA to earn the right to recommend.** Unlike Pyramid where you lead with the answer, SCQA earns credibility by demonstrating you understand the landscape first.

7. **Front-load the strongest Complication data.** Lead with the most quantified and urgent point — declining metrics, competitive threats with timelines, or customer attrition.
