# Slide Pattern A: Pyramid Principle Slide Pattern

> **Note:** The `---` dividers in this file are documentation section boundaries. When generating presentation output, use `---` only as slide boundary markers per SKILL.md format rules.

## Pattern Overview

**Designation:** Pattern A (Layer 2 -- Slide-Level Pattern)
**Concept:** Every slide leads with a conclusion-stating action title, supported by evidence in the body that proves the title's claim.
**Origin:** Barbara Minto / McKinsey & Company
**Best For:** Executive briefings, strategy recommendations, data-driven analysis, any slide where the audience needs the "so what" instantly.

**When to Use:**
- The slide presents a finding, conclusion, or recommendation
- You want the audience to grasp the main point before reading details
- The deck will be shared asynchronously (read without a presenter)
- Executives or senior decision-makers are the audience
- You are building evidence slides within any meta-flow

**When NOT to Use:**
- Title slides, section dividers, or agenda slides
- Slides designed for emotional impact in storytelling flows
- Interactive workshop slides where the audience discovers the answer
- Appendix or reference slides that serve as data lookup tables
- Hook or attention slides that use provocative questions

---

## Core Philosophy

**Every slide should pass the "so what" test.** If your title does not state a conclusion, the slide lacks purpose.

The pattern inverts the instinct to describe then conclude. Instead, state the conclusion first, then provide evidence. This matters because:

1. **Respect for the reader's time.** Executives scan titles. If titles state conclusions, the audience absorbs the argument in 60 seconds by reading only the title strip of each slide.
2. **Discipline of thought.** Writing an action title forces you to know what the slide says. A topic title like "Market Analysis" hides behind vagueness. If you cannot write an action title, you do not yet know what the slide proves.
3. **Structural integrity.** When every title states a conclusion, the deck becomes a self-validating logical chain. Contradictions between slides become immediately visible.
4. **Async readability.** Decks are forwarded, printed, and read without the presenter more often than they are presented live. Action titles make the deck a standalone document.

**The acid test:** Print your deck with only titles visible. Can a reader follow your complete argument? If not, your titles are topic titles, not action titles.

## Detailed Element Guide

### Action Title

The most important element. A complete sentence stating the slide's conclusion.

**Rules:**
- Must be a complete sentence (subject, verb, object)
- 8-12 words ideal (never exceed 18)
- Specific and quantified where data exists
- Must be falsifiable -- someone could disagree with it
- Contains no hedge words: "may," "could," "might," "significant," "various"
- Should pass the "newspaper headline" test -- could this be a headline?

**Good Action Titles:**
- "Enterprise segment generates 73% gross margin vs 51% for SMB"
- "Customer acquisition cost has risen 60% YoY, eroding unit economics"
- "European market offers $2.1B TAM with no incumbent above 9% share"
- "Consolidate to a single CRM platform to save $4.2M annually"

**Bad Topic Titles:**
- "Market Analysis" -- what did the analysis find?
- "Financial Overview" -- could mean literally anything
- "Competitive Landscape" -- tells me the category, not the insight
- "Q3 Results" -- good results? bad results? what changed?

### Supporting Content

The body exists to **prove the title's claim**. It should not repeat the title -- every element in the body adds new evidence.

**Rules for Bullets:**
- Maximum 5 bullets per slide (3-4 ideal)
- Each bullet 1-2 lines maximum
- Bullets provide distinct, independently verifiable evidence
- Parallel structure throughout (all start with nouns, all start with verbs, etc.)
- Each bullet should pass the "does this support the title?" test
- Order bullets by strength: strongest evidence first

**Good Supporting Bullets (for title: "European expansion will drive 40% revenue growth by 2027"):**
- "Addressable market is $2.1B with 12% annual growth" -- quantified market size
- "No dominant incumbent: top 3 hold only 22% combined share" -- competitive opportunity
- "Early UK pilot validated 18% conversion vs 14% NA benchmark" -- proof point

**Bad Supporting Bullets:**
- "Europe is an interesting market" -- subjective, does not prove anything
- "We have discussed this in leadership meetings" -- process update, not evidence
- "Revenue grew 40% last year" -- repeats the title instead of proving it

**Rules for Charts:**
- One chart per slide ideal; two maximum
- Include annotation pointing to the key data point that supports the title
- Always label axes, units, and time periods
- The chart type should match the message: trend = line, comparison = bar, composition = pie/stacked bar
- Every chart must include a text callout or annotation that connects it to the title's claim

### Source / Footer

- Include when citing external data or when audience may question the source
- Format: "Source: [Organization/Report Name], [Date/Period]"
- Omit for internal data that the audience will not challenge

## Title Transformation Examples

| Topic Title (Weak) | Action Title (Strong) |
|---|---|
| "Market Analysis" | "European market offers $2.1B TAM with no incumbent above 9% share" |
| "Q3 Revenue" | "Q3 revenue beat forecast by 12% driven by early enterprise deal closures" |
| "Customer Feedback" | "NPS decline from 72 to 61 is isolated to onboarding, not product quality" |
| "Cost Structure" | "Fixed costs at 60% of total limit short-term reduction options" |
| "Competitive Update" | "Competitor X's acquisition of Y closes our 18-month technology lead" |
| "Next Steps" | "Three hires and one vendor contract will close the Q1 capability gap" |

## Title Writing Guide

### The "So What" Test

1. Read your title aloud
2. Ask: "So what?"
3. If the answer is "well, the point is that..." -- THAT is your real title
4. Repeat until the title withstands the question

### Title Formulas

**Finding/Data:** `[Subject] [verb] [quantified outcome] [timeframe/comparison]`
Example: "Customer churn increased 40% in Q3, concentrated in SMB segment"

**Recommendation:** `[Action verb] [in what] to [achieve quantified outcome]`
Example: "Consolidate to a single CRM platform to save $4.2M annually"

**Comparison:** `[Subject A] [outperforms/underperforms] [Subject B] by [metric]`
Example: "Enterprise segment outperforms SMB by 22 percentage points on gross margin"

**Implication:** `[Data point] [means/signals/confirms] [strategic conclusion]`
Example: "Rising CAC confirms channel saturation, requiring pivot to organic acquisition"

### DO Examples

1. "Enterprise segment generates 73% gross margin vs 51% for SMB"
2. "Customer acquisition cost rose 60% YoY, now exceeding first-year revenue per customer"
3. "European market offers $2.1B TAM with no incumbent holding more than 9% share"
4. "We recommend acquiring Company X to close the AI capability gap within 6 months"

### DON'T Examples

1. "Market Analysis" -- describes the slide topic, not the finding
2. "Financial Performance" -- could mean anything; no conclusion
3. "Next Steps" -- a section header, not a statement
4. "Summary" -- the laziest possible title

## Before/After Examples

### Example 1: Financial Data Slide

**BEFORE:**
```
Title: "Q3 Financial Results"
* Revenue: $48.2M
* Gross Margin: 62%
* Operating Expenses: $31.4M
* Net Income: $5.1M
```
**Problem:** Title is a topic label. Bullets are a data dump with no interpretation.

**AFTER:**
```
Title: "Q3 revenue beat forecast by 12% but margin compressed
200 bps due to enterprise onboarding investments"

* Revenue of $48.2M exceeded $43.0M target, driven by 3 large
  enterprise deals closing ahead of schedule
* Gross margin declined from 64% to 62% as enterprise onboarding
  required $1.3M in one-time professional services spend
* Net income of $5.1M represents first quarter above $5M threshold

```

### Example 2: Market Analysis Slide

**BEFORE:**
```
Title: "Competitive Landscape"
* Competitor A: 18% market share
* Competitor B: 14% market share
* Our share: 7% market share
```
**Problem:** Title tells you the topic but not what the landscape means for strategy.

**AFTER:**
```
Title: "Fragmented market with no dominant player creates a window
for share capture through our differentiated platform approach"

* Market is highly fragmented: top 3 hold only 41% combined share
* No competitor offers both cloud-native and on-prem deployment
* Market growing at 15% CAGR means each point of share captured
  today is worth $34M annually by 2028

## Variations by Audience

| Audience | Title Style | Body Content | Tone |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Executive / Board** | Quantified with $, %, timeframes | 3 max bullets, summary-level data | Decisive, direct, no hedging |
| **Technical** | Conclusion-first with technical specifics | 4-5 bullets OK, include methodology notes | Precise, evidence-based |
| **Sales / External** | Benefit-oriented, customer value language | Outcomes, proof points, benchmarks | Confident, customer-framed |
| **Internal / Team** | Operational focus, internal metrics | More context and nuance OK | Collaborative, action-oriented |

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Topic titles instead of action titles.** "Market Analysis" forces readers to scan every bullet to understand the point. Fix: state the conclusion in the title.
2. **Title does not match body content.** Title says "profitable" but body shows satisfaction data. Fix: align evidence to claim. Read the title, then read each bullet -- does each bullet support the title?
3. **Too many bullets (>5).** Cognitive overload -- nothing gets absorbed. Fix: group into themes across multiple slides or move supporting detail to appendix.
4. **Bullets repeat the title.** Wastes prime slide real estate. Fix: each bullet should add new evidence that proves the title. If a bullet says the same thing as the title in different words, delete it.
5. **Chart without annotation.** Audience hunts for the relevant data point. Fix: highlight or annotate the specific data point that supports the title's claim.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Title is a complete sentence stating a conclusion, not a topic
- [ ] Title is specific and quantified where data exists (8-12 words, max 18)
- [ ] Title contains no hedge words (may, could, might, significant, various)
- [ ] Title passes the "so what" test -- reading it alone conveys the slide's point
- [ ] Body directly supports the title's claim with distinct evidence
- [ ] No bullet repeats or paraphrases the title
- [ ] Maximum 5 bullets (ideally 3-4), each 1-2 lines
- [ ] Charts have annotations highlighting the key data point
- [ ] Data sources are cited in the footer when external
- [ ] Slide conveys exactly one main message

## Pro Tips

1. **Write titles last.** Draft the body first, then ask "What does this evidence prove?" That answer is your title. This ensures the title reflects reality, not aspiration.
2. **Test with titles only.** Print the deck and read only the title strip of each slide. If the argument flows coherently, you have a strong deck. If you need the body to follow along, your titles are not carrying their weight.
3. **Quantify relentlessly.** Replace every vague adjective with a number. "Significant growth" becomes "34% growth." "Several customers" becomes "47 customers." "Recently" becomes "in Q3 2025."
4. **Use the title as your edit filter.** If a bullet does not support the title, move it to appendix or delete it. If a chart does not support the title, it belongs on a different slide. Everything on the slide must serve the title's claim.
5. **Make titles falsifiable.** "European market is more attractive than APAC" is falsifiable -- someone could argue otherwise with data. "Market Overview" is not falsifiable and therefore communicates nothing. Falsifiable titles force rigorous thinking.
